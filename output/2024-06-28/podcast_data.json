According to Soper, Adept co-founder and CEO David Luan will join Amazon, along with Adept co-founders Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Erich Elsen and Kelsey Szot and other Adept employees.\nAdept isn\u2019t closing up shop, however. Zach Brock, head of engineering, is taking over as CEO as Adept refocuses its efforts on \u201csolutions that enable agentic AI.\u201d\n\u201c[Our products] will continue to be powered by a combination of our existing state-of-the-art in-house [AI] models, agentic data, web interaction software and custom infrastructure,\u201d Adept wrote in a post on its official blog. \u201cContinuing with Adept\u2019s initial plan of building both useful general intelligence and an enterprise agent product would\u2019ve required spending significant attention on fundraising for our foundation models, rather than bringing to life our agent vision.\u201d\nThe deal provides a lifeline for Adept, which has reportedly been in talks with Meta and Microsoft over the past few months about a potential acquisition. Microsoft previously invested in the startup.\nAs for Amazon, it gets valuable talent \u2014 and tech to bolster its generative AI ambitions. Geekwire reports that Luan will work under Rohit Prasad, the former Alexa head who\u2019s leading a new AGI team focused on building large language models.\n\u201cDavid and his team\u2019s expertise in training state-of-the-art multimodal foundational models and building real-world digital agents aligns with our vision to delight consumer and enterprise customers with practical AI solutions,\u201d Prasad wrote in a memo to employees obtained by Geekwire. \u201c[The license] will accelerate our roadmap for building digital agents that can automate software workflows.\u201d\nAdept was founded two years ago with the goal of creating an AI model that can perform actions on any software tool using natural language. At a high level, the vision \u2014 a vision now shared by OpenAI, Rabbit and others \u2014 was to create an \u201cAI teammate\u201d of sorts trained to use a wide variety of different software tools and APIs.\nAdept managed to win over backers including Nvidia, Atlassian, Workday and Greylock with its technology, raising over $415 million in capital and reaching a valuation of around $1 billion. But the startup\u2019s been plagued with disfunction. Adept lost two of its co-founders, Ashish Vaswani and Niki Parmar, early on, and it\u2019s struggled to bring any product to market despite months and months of testing.\nThe market for AI agents is a tad more crowded than it was at Adept\u2019s launch. Well-funded startups like Orby, Emergence and others are vying for a slice of what promises to be a lucrative pie; market research firm Grand View Research estimates that the AI agents segment was worth $4.2 billion in 2022.\nBut perhaps the Amazon tie-in will get Adept over the finish line. Or \u2014 with much of its executive ranks departing \u2014 it\u2019ll resign Adept to the same fate as Inflection, the AI startup that was effectively gutted, talent-wise, by Microsoft earlier this year. Or regulators increasingly skeptical of these types of AI aqui-hires will step in (if they aren\u2019t rendered toothless by Friday\u2019s Supreme Court decision).\nGrab your popcorn and settle in.\n\ntitle1:\nSupreme Court ruling kneecaps federal regulators\ndescription1:\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court overturned a long-standing legal doctrine in the US, making a transformative ruling that could hamper federal agencies\u2019 ability to regulate all kinds of industry. Six Republican-appointed justices voted to overturn the doctrine, called Chevron deference, a decision that could affect everything from pollution limits to consumer protections in the US.\nChevron deference allows courts to defer to federal agencies when there are disputes over how to interpret ambiguous language in legislation passed by Congress. That\u2019s supposed to lead to more informed decisions by leaning on expertise within those agencies. By overturning the Chevron doctrine, the conservative-dominated SCOTUS decided that judges ought to make the call instead of agency experts.\n\u201cPerhaps most fundamentally, Chevron\u2019s presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts writes in his opinion.\nRelated How SCOTUS could gut environmental protections in 2024\nThe decision effectively strips federal agencies of a tool they\u2019ve been able to use to take action on pressing issues while Congress tries to catch up with new laws. Chevron deference has come up, for instance, in efforts to use the 1970 Clean Air Act to prevent the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Overturning it is a big win for lobbyists and anyone else who might want to make it harder to crack down on industry through federal regulation.\n\u201cIt would really unleash a kind of chaotic period of time where federal courts are deciding what they think all these laws mean. And that can lead to a lot of inconsistency and confusion for agencies and for regulated parties,\u201d Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard, previously told The Verge when SCOTUS heard oral arguments over Chevron deference in January.\nIt\u2019s called Chevron deference because of a 1984 ruling, Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). In that case, the Supreme Court sided with Chevron rather than the environmental group NRDC \u2014 allowing the then industry-friendly Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan to stick with a more lax interpretation of the Clean Air Act. It shows how Chevron deference has been sort of politically agnostic in the past, even though the more recent push to overrule it has aligned with a deregulatory agenda.\nIn her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that Chevron deference \u201chas formed the backdrop against which Congress, courts, and agencies \u2014 as well as regulated parties and the public \u2014 all have operated for decades. It has been applied in thousands of judicial decisions. It has become part of the warp and woof of modern government, supporting regulatory efforts of all kinds \u2014 to name a few, keeping air and water clean, food and drugs safe, and financial markets honest.\u201d Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined the dissent. (In a complicated little detail that doesn\u2019t matter due to the sheer numbers the majority had, Justice Jackson\u2019s dissenting vote only applies to Relentless, since she recused herself in Loper Bright.)\n\u201cIf they toss Chevron out, the Court would be inviting unaccountable judges to freely impose their policy preferences over those of the political branches \u2014 exactly what Chevron sought to stop,\u201d David Doniger, a senior adviser to the NRDC Action Fund and an attorney who litigated the 1984 case, said in a press briefing earlier this month.\nRelated Why a Supreme Court decision on fishing boats could change everything\nSCOTUS took up Chevron deference this year because of two cases brought by the fishing industry: Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce. The plaintiffs challenged a federal rule that makes fishing companies pay for the cost of observers on vessels to monitor their operations, saying the National Marine Fisheries Service doesn\u2019t actually have the authority to force them to pay because it\u2019s not explicitly written into the fishery conservation statute. Lower courts upheld the mandate, applying Chevron deference.\nBut there\u2019s a lot more at stake with these cases than fishing boats. Trade groups representing a broad swath of interests from Gun Owners of America to e-cigarette companies have all pushed to overturn or limit Chevron deference.\nThe fate of net neutrality in the US, for instance, has been tied to Chevron deference. Courts have previously deferred to the FCC on how to define broadband. Is it considered a telecommunications or information service? If it\u2019s telecommunications, then it\u2019s subject to \u201ccommon carrier\u201d regulations and restrictions placed on public utilities to ensure fair access. The FCC has flip-flopped on the issue between the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations \u2014 with the FCC deciding in April to restore net neutrality rules.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI, Microsoft sued by Center for Investigative Reporting\ndescription2:\nThe news industry just gained a powerful ally in its effort to take on OpenAI.\nThe Center for Investigative Reporting, the country's oldest nonprofit newsroom, sued OpenAI and lead backer Microsoft in federal court on Thursday for alleged copyright infringement, following similar suits from publications including The New York Times , Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News.\nThe CIR alleged in the suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, that OpenAI \"copied, used, abridged, and displayed CIR's valuable content without CIR's permission or authorization, and without any compensation to CIR.\"\nSince its public release in late 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has been crawling the web to provide answers to user queries, often relying heavily on copy pulled directly from news stories.\n\"When they populated their training sets with works of journalism, Defendants had a choice: to respect works of journalism, or not,\" the plaintiffs wrote in the lawsuit. \"Defendants chose the latter.\"\nIn a press release on Thursday, Monika Bauerlein, CEO of the nonprofit, accused the defendants of \"free rider behavior.\"\n\"OpenAI and Microsoft started vacuuming up our stories to make their product more powerful, but they never asked for permission or offered compensation, unlike other organizations that license our material,\" Bauerlein said.\nThe CIR, which is home to Mother Jones and audio programming Reveal, also alleged in the suit that OpenAI \"trained ChatGPT not to acknowledge or respect copyright. And they did this all without permission.\"\nThe group said it's seeking \"actual damages and Defendants' profits, or statutory damages of no less than $750 per infringed work and $2,500 per DMCA violation,\" referring to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"We are working collaboratively with the news industry and partnering with global news publishers to display their content in our products like ChatGPT, including summaries, quotes, and attribution, to drive traffic back to the original articles,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC. \"A component of the partnerships is the ability to leverage publisher content using various machine learning and training techniques to help us optimize the display of that content and make it more useful to users.\"\nWith the news industry broadly struggling to maintain sufficient advertising and subscription revenue to pay for its costly newsgathering operations, many publications are aggressively trying to protect their businesses as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent.\nIn December, The New York Times filed a suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging intellectual property violations related to its journalistic content appearing in ChatGPT training data. The Times said it seeks to hold Microsoft and OpenAI accountable for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of the Times's uniquely valuable works,\" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. OpenAI disagreed with the Times' characterization of events.\nThe Chicago Tribune, along with seven other newspapers, followed with a similar suit in April.\nOutside of news, a group of prominent U.S. authors, including Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult, sued OpenAI last year, alleging copyright infringement in using their work to train ChatGPT.\nBut not all news organizations are gearing up for a fight, and some are instead joining forces with OpenAI. Earlier on Thursday, OpenAI and Time magazine announced a \"multi-year content deal\" that will allow OpenAI to access current and archived articles from more than 100 years of Time's history.\nOpenAI will be able to display Time's content within its ChatGPT chatbot in response to user questions, according to a press release, and to use Time's content \"to enhance its products,\" or, likely, to train its artificial intelligence models.\nOpenAI announced a similar partnership in May with News Corp. , allowing OpenAI to access current and archived articles from The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Barron's, the New York Post and other publications. Reddit also announced in May that it will partner with OpenAI, allowing the company to train its AI models on Reddit content.\nWATCH: Microsoft gets put on AI backfoot after Apple-OpenAI deal\n\ntitle3:\nHubSpot says it's investigating customer account hacks\ndescription3:\nMarketing and sales software giant HubSpot said on Friday that it\u2019s investigating a cybersecurity incident.\nOn Friday, rumors of some kind of cyberattack against HubSpot began circulating on social media. When reached by TechCrunch on Friday, HubSpot\u2019s chief information security officer Alyssa Robinson said in a statement that the company \u201cidentified a security incident that involved bad actors targeting a limited number of HubSpot customers and attempting to gain unauthorized access to their accounts.\u201d\nContact Us Do you have more information about the HubSpot breach?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\n\u201cHubSpot triggered our incident response procedures, and since June 22 we have been contacting impacted customers and taking necessary steps to revoke the unauthorized access and protect our customers and their data,\u201d said Robinson.\nThe company did not say, when asked by TechCrunch, if it has received any communication from the malicious actors.\nHubSpot is a U.S.-based company that specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing automation software, and has a market cap of almost $30 billion as of Friday.\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s the extent of the incident and how many HubSpot customers were affected.\nHubSpot says it has more than 216,000 corporate clients, and touts Discord, Eventbrite, Talkspace and others as big name customers.\"\n\nResponse:",
