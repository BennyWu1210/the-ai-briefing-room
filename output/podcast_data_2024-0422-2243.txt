 UnitedHealth says Change hackers stole health data on 'substantial proportion of people in America'
UnitedHealth says Change hackers stole health data on ‘substantial proportion of people in America’ The health tech giant handles health data for about half of all Americans
Health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group has confirmed that a ransomware attack on its health tech subsidiary Change Healthcare earlier this year resulted in a huge theft of Americans’ private healthcare data.
UnitedHealth said in a statement on Monday that a ransomware gang took files containing personal data and protected health information that it says may “cover a substantial proportion of people in America.”
The health insurance giant did not say how many Americans are affected but said the data review was “likely to take several months” before the company would begin notifying individuals that their information was stolen in the cyberattack.
Change Healthcare processes insurance and billing for hundreds of thousands of hospitals, pharmacies and medical practices across the U.S. healthcare sector; it has access to massive amounts of health information on about half of all Americans.
UnitedHealth said it had not yet seen evidence that doctors’ charts or full medical histories were exfiltrated from its systems.
The admission that hackers stole Americans’ health data comes a week after a new hacking group began publishing portions of the stolen data in an effort to extort a second ransom demand from the company.
The gang, which calls itself RansomHub, published several files on its dark web leak site containing personal information about patients across an array of documents, some of which included internal files related to Change Healthcare. RansomHub said it would sell the stolen data unless Change Healthcare paid a ransom.
In a statement provided to TechCrunch, UnitedHealth spokesperson Tyler Mason confirmed the company paid the cybercriminals. “A ransom was paid as part of the company’s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure.” The company would not confirm the amount it paid.
RansomHub is the second gang to demand a ransom from Change Healthcare. The health tech giant reportedly paid $22 million to a Russia-based criminal gang called ALPHV in March, which then disappeared, stiffing the affiliate that carried out the data theft out of their portion of the ransom.
RansomHub claimed in its post alongside the published stolen data that “we have the data and not ALPHV.”
In its statement Monday, UnitedHealth acknowledged the publication of some of the files but stopped short of claiming ownership of the documents. “This is not an official breach notification,” UnitedHealth said.
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the criminal hacking affiliate of ALPHV broke into Change Healthcare’s network using stolen credentials for a system that allows remote access to its network. The hackers were in Change Healthcare’s network for more than a week before deploying ransomware, allowing the hackers to steal significant amounts of data from the company’s systems.
The cyberattack at Change Healthcare began on February 21 and resulted in ongoing widespread outages at pharmacies and hospitals across the United States. For weeks, physicians, pharmacies and hospitals could not verify patient benefits for dispensing medications, organizing inpatient care, or processing prior authorizations necessary for surgeries.
Much of the U.S. healthcare system ground to a halt, with healthcare providers facing financial pressure as backlogs grow and outages linger.
UnitedHealth reported last week that the ransomware attack has cost it more than $870 million in losses. The company reported it made $99.8 billion in revenue during the first three months of the year, faring better than what Wall Street analysts had expected.
UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty, who received close to $21 million in total compensation the full year of 2022, is set to testify to House lawmakers on May 1.
Updated with comment from UnitedHealth.

Amazon ends California drone deliveries
Amazon confirmed it is ending Prime Air drone delivery operations in Lockeford, California. The Central California town of 3,500 was the company’s second U.S. drone delivery site, after College Station, Texas. Operations were announced in June 2022.
The retail giant is not offering details around the setback, only noting, “We’ll offer all current employees opportunities at other sites, and will continue to serve customers in Lockeford with other delivery methods. We want to thank the community for all their support and feedback over the past few years.”
College Station deliveries will continue, along with a forthcoming site in Tolleson, Arizona set to kick off deliveries later this year. Tolleson, a city of just over 7,000, is located in Maricopa County, in the western portion of the Phoenix metropolitan area.
Prime Air’s arrival brings same-day deliveries to Amazon customers in the region, courtesy of a hybrid fulfillment center/delivery station. The company says it will be contacting impacted customers when the service is up and running. There’s no specific information on timing beyond “this year,” owing, in part, to ongoing negotiations with both local officials and the FAA required to deploy in the airspace.
Expansion of the offering has been extremely slow going, in part due to regulatory matters. For much of the project’s life, it has seemed as if Amazon was simply dipping its toes in the unproven waters of drone delivery. It seems that Tolleson will be the service’s sole expansion this calendar year, with additional news held off until 2025. It remains to be seen whether the company will re-engage with California locales.
Amazon did reassert its commitment late last year, with the announcement of medication deliveries in College Station, bringing select Amazon Pharmacy orders to customers in less than an hour.
Select local governments clearly see these sorts of deals as an opportunity to advertise an openness to technological innovation outside of traditional hot spots like San Francisco or New York.
“This kind of delivery is the future, and it’s exciting that it will be starting in the Phoenix Metro Area,” Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego says. “The shift toward zero-emission package delivery will help us reduce local pollution and further cement our city as a hotbed for the innovative technology of tomorrow.”

Tesla earnings week spotlights price cuts, Elon's 'balls to the wall' autonomy push
As Tesla gears up to report what will likely be unimpressive financial results for the first quarter on Tuesday, the company is making more moves to go “balls to the wall for autonomy,” as CEO Elon Musk put it last week in a post on X.
Over the weekend, Tesla dropped the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver-assistance system to $8,000, down from $12,000. That price cut is in addition to last week’s drop of the FSD monthly subscription to $99, down from $199. The push to get FSD into more cars could be a bid to collect more data as Tesla works to boost the neural networks that will power fuller-scale autonomy. FSD today can perform many driving tasks in cities and on highways, but still requires a human to remain alert with their hands on the wheel in case the system requires a takeover.
Tesla faces narrowing profits as it places a major and expensive bet on autonomous driving technology. Last week, Tesla laid off 10% of its staff in a move to reduce costs in preparation for the company’s “next growth phase,” per an email Musk sent to all employees.
Earlier this month, Musk abruptly announced on X that Tesla was pausing the development of its $25,000 electric vehicle in favor of a robotaxi that he promised to reveal in August. Sources within Tesla have confirmed to TechCrunch that they didn’t have prior warning from Musk on this sudden shift and that internal restructurings reflect a new ethos that puts robotaxi development at front and center.
All of this is happening as Tesla zigzags on its EV pricing strategy.
Last week, Tesla ditched EV inventory price discounts, but over the weekend slashed prices on the Model 3 and Model Y by as much as $2,000 in the U.S., China and Germany. As we saw during the first quarter of 2023, those price cuts are taking their toll on Tesla’s income and margins.
Tesla is scheduled to report earnings after markets close April 23. Musk has previously said that without autonomy, Tesla is “basically worth zero.”
The company will need to convince investors tomorrow that its shift in priority to autonomous vehicles is a silver lining in the cloud of declining margins, rather than just smoke and mirrors.
Since Musk laid off staff and announced that Tesla would be going hard on autonomy, Tesla’s share price has dropped almost 10%. Shares have fallen over 42% since the start of the year.
What to expect at Tesla’s Q1 2024 earnings
Tesla’s lower first-quarter delivery figures combined with price cuts are ingredients for a smaller profit pie. And analysts seem to agree.
Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance expect a profit of $0.48 per share on $20.94 billion in revenue. As a reminder, Tesla generated $25.17 billion revenue in Q4 and $23.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023.
Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024, down 20% from the 484,507 it delivered in the final quarter of 2023. It’s worth noting that this wasn’t just a quarter-over-quarter blip. Tesla delivered fewer cars than the first quarter of 2023 — the first year-over-year drop in sales in three years.
Tesla’s Q4 results show a company already grappling with shrinking profit margins due to its price-cutting strategy, rising costs of its Cybertruck production launch and other R&D expenses.
The automaker reported net income, on a GAAP basis, of $7.9 billion in the fourth quarter — an outsized number caused by a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $5.9 billion. The company’s operating income and its earnings on an adjusted basis provided a clearer picture of its financial performance.
Tesla reported operating income of $2.06 billion in the fourth quarter, a 47% decrease from the same year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.9 billion, a 27% drop from the same period last year.
The question is whether Tesla can prevent that profit pie from shrinking to profit muffin.
Since Tesla reported its Q1 2024 production and delivery numbers, the company has continued to pull various financial levers aimed at attracting new buyers and inducing existing customers to pay for FSD — all while reducing costs and maintaining profit margins.
Those opposing goals coupled with Musk’s “wartime CEO mode” status are bound to make the Q1 earnings call entertaining. Beyond that potential theater, there are pressing long-term questions about how Tesla delivers on autonomy and if it will be enough to convince investors that it can still lead and innovate.

EU opens probe of TikTok Lite, citing concerns about addictive design
The European Union has opened a second formal investigation into TikTok, announcing Monday that it suspects the video sharing platform of breaking the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), an online governance and content moderation framework.
The Commission also said it’s minded to impose interim measures that could force the company to suspend access to the TikTok Lite app in the EU while it investigates concerns the app poses mental health risks to users. Although the EU has given TikTok until April 24 to argue against the measure — meaning the app remains accessible for now.
The development shows the EU cracking down on a product launch it deems risky where it can show a platform has not followed expected procedure.
Penalties for confirmed violations of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover. So ByteDance, TikTok’s parent, could face hefty fines if EU enforcers do end up deciding it has broken the law.
While the Commission hasn’t yet confirmed any breaches of the DSA this is the second probe it’s opened on TikTok after announcing an (ongoing) investigation into multiple aspects of its DSA compliance back in February. Since December X has also been under investigation over a range of DSA compliance concerns.
The EU’s first TikTok probe covers multiple issues including the protection of minors, advertising transparency, data access for researchers and the risk management of addictive design and harmful content. Hence it said the latest investigation will specifically focus on TikTok Lite, a version of the video sharing platform which launched earlier this month in France and Spain and includes a mechanism that allows users to earn points for doing things like watching or liking videos.
Points earned through TikTok Lite can be exchanged for things like Amazon gift vouchers or TikTok’s own digital currency for gifting to creators. The Commission is worried this so-called “task and reward” feature could negatively impact the mental health of young users by “stimulating addictive behavior”.
The EU wrote that the second probe will focus on TikTok’s compliance with the DSA obligation to conduct and submit a risk assessment report prior to the launch of the “Task and Reward Lite” program, with a particular focus on negative effects on mental health, including minors’ mental health. It also said it will look into measures taken by TikTok to mitigate those risks.
In a press release announcing the action, the EU said ByteDance failed to produce a risk assessment about the feature which it had asked to see last week — when it gave the company 24 hours to produce the document.
TikTok is regulated under the strictest regime of the DSA, which applies to around half a dozen larger platforms. This extra layer of risk mitigation requirements obliges them to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks — such as addictive design that could harm users’ mental health.
The EU’s suspicion is ByteDance failed to do this before going ahead and launching TikTok Lite in the two EU markets: Since it failed to submit the risk assessment paperwork on April 18 the Commission wrote that it suspects a “prima facie infringement of the DSA”.
The regulation bakes in a regime of smaller fines for failures to produce requested information on time, as appears to have happened here. ByteDance could therefore face a penalty of up to 1% of its total annual income or worldwide turnover and periodic penalties up to 5% of average daily income or worldwide annual turnover specifically for this type of DSA compliance failure.
Although the Commission has not confirmed whether it plans to fine TikTok for failing to produce the risk assessment document on time as yet.
ByteDance was contacted for a response to the EU’s latest DSA enforcement. But as of press time it had not responded. Update: A TikTok spokesperson said: “We are disappointed with this decision — the TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks. We will continue discussions with the Commission.”
It’s worth noting the EU’s press release raises specific concerns about “the suspected absence of effective age verification mechanisms on TikTok”, which is an area the Commission’s first TikTok investigation is looking into.
Commenting on the Commission’s enforcement action in a statement, Thierry Breton, the commissioner for the EU Internal Market, wrote: “Endless streams of short and fast-paced videos could be seen as fun, but also expose our children to risks of addiction, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, low attention spans… With our first DSA non-compliance case against TikTok still ongoing, the company has launched TikTok Lite which financially rewards extra screen time. We suspect TikTok ‘Lite’ could be as toxic and addictive as cigarettes ‘light’. Unless TikTok provides compelling proof of its safety, which it has failed to do until now, we stand ready to trigger DSA interim measures including the suspension of TikTok Lite feature which we suspect could generate addiction. We will spare no effort to protect our children.”
This report was updated with comment from TikTok; and to confirm the platform’s approach to age verification is being investigated by the EU.

Meta opens Quest OS to third-party headset makers, taps Lenovo and Xbox as partners
The mixed reality operating system that powers Meta Quest headsets can officially be used by third-party device makers, the company announced on Monday. Three major tech players — Asus, Lenovo and Microsoft’s Xbox — are the first companies to confirm they’ll be developing new devices that run the software.
Now called “Meta Horizon OS,” the open system allows developers to access technologies like eye, face, hand and body tracking and high-resolution passthrough, a popular mixed reality feature where users can still see their surroundings while wearing the headset. The company says all future headsets can connect via the Meta Quest app on iOS and Android devices.
Notably, Microsoft is teaming up with Meta to build a “limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox,” according to the announcement. Asus and Lenovo, on the other hand, are building headsets designed for specific use cases. For instance, Asus is developing a headset dedicated to gaming whereas Lenovo wants its device to be for “productivity, learning, and entertainment.”
Meta Horizon OS comes at a time when the VR/AR headset wars between Meta, Apple and Sony continue to heat up. While the open operating system is certainly a strategic and interesting move for the company, the question remains if it will give Meta a leg up in the race or if the Quest-like headsets will even be popular.

i'm wall-e, stepping in for your tech briefing today. starting with a headline grabbing unitedhealth, wrestling with the aftermath of a ransomware attack on change healthcare. this breach has thrown a spotlight on the vulnerability of private health data, with a "substantial proportion of people in america" affected. with unitedhealth's data network sprawling across roughly half the american populace, this incident could take months to quantify fully. adding to the intrigue, change healthcare has succumbed to paying ransoms to two different hacker groups this year alone, forking over a staggering $22 million to a russia-based syndicate. despite these payouts, the leaked data has ominously started to find its way online, catapulting us into a maelstrom of privacy and security debates.

shifting gears to amazon, which is recalibrating its prime air drone delivery ventures. specifically, it's dialing down operations in lockeford, california, though its narrative continues in college station, texas, and is set to broaden to tolleson, arizona. this pivot poses questions about the trajectory of drone delivery within amazon's comprehensive logistics game plan.

in the electric vehicle arena, tesla is navigating an earnings week that's under the microscope, coupling price cuts on its full self-driving package with a keen push toward autonomy. amid this strategic maneuvering, the electric juggernaut is cornered by financial strains and a pressing need for data to power its ai ambitions. it's a watershed moment for tesla to sell its autonomous driving vision to investors, against a backdrop of squeezed margins and workforce reductions.

across the atlantic, the european union's gaze is fixed on tiktok lite, initiating a formal investigation amidst concerns the app's design might be fostering addictive behaviors among users. this marks the eu's second inquest into tiktok, amping up the pressure on bytedance with potential penalties that could slice up to 6% off the company's global annual turnover, hinting at severe financial fallout.

lastly, pivoting to the metaverse, meta is stitching partnerships with tech behemoths asus, lenovo, and microsoft's xbox for a fresh wave of devices powered by meta horizon os. by throwing open its mixed reality operating system to third-party manufacturers, meta is staking its claim in the cutthroat vr/ar battleground, aiming to solidify its presence.

我是wall-e，这是您的ai简报。健康保险巨头unitedhealth group确认，今年早些时候其健康科技子公司change healthcare遭受的勒索软件攻击导致大量美国人的私人健康数据被盗。unitedhealth在周一的声明中表示，勒索软件团伙窃取了包含个人数据和受保护健康信息的文件，可能“涵盖美国相当比例的人口”。该健康保险巨头没有透露受影响的美国公民数量，但表示数据审查“可能需要几个月”的时间，然后公司才会开始通知个人他们的信息在网络攻击中被盗。另外，亚马逊确认将结束加州洛克福德的prime air无人机配送业务，该中心加州城镇是该公司在美国的第二个无人机配送站，继德克萨斯州的学院站之后。与此同时，特斯拉在准备报告可能并不令人印象深刻的第一季度财务结果时，正采取更多措施全力以赴推进自动驾驶技术。最后，欧盟已经对tiktok lite开展了第二次正式调查，周一宣布怀疑这个视频分享平台违反了该集团的数字服务法案（dsa），这是一个在线治理和内容调节框架。同时，元宇宙公司meta宣布，支持meta quest耳机的混合现实操作系统现在可以由第三方设备制造商正式使用，包括华硕、联想和微软的xbox在内的三大技术公司是首批确认将开发运行该软件的新设备的公司。这是今天的所有内容，我们明天再见。
