    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday August 19), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI says Iran tried to influence US elections with ChatGPT\ndescription0:\nOpenAI has banned a string of ChatGPT accounts tied to an Iranian influence campaign that generated and shared content related to the US presidential election, among other topics. The operation mainly used ChatGPT to create longform articles and social media comments for platforms like Instagram and X, according to OpenAI.\nOpenAI linked the accounts to Storm-2035, a covert Iranian influence operation that has attempted to engage US voters by launching websites disguised as political news outlets. In addition to commentary about the US election on both sides of the political spectrum, OpenAI says the operation generated content about the Israel-Hamas war, Israel at the Olympic Games, politics in Venezuela, and \u201cthe rights of Latinx communities\u201d in the US.\nThese posts on X show how the operation generated content on both sides of the US political spectrum. Image: OpenAI\nOpenAI says that its investigation found the campaign \u201cdoes not appear to have achieved meaningful audience engagement.\u201d The AI company says most social media posts it tracked down received \u201cfew or no likes, shares, or comments.\u201d In May, OpenAI and Meta announced they\u2019d disrupted a social media campaign that used AI to post pro-Israel messages on Instagram and Facebook.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta draws fresh questions from EU over its CrowdTangle shut-down\ndescription1:\nThe Commission is seeking more information from Meta following its decision to deprecate its CrowdTangle transparency tool. The latest EU request for information (RFI) on Meta has been made under the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 an online governance framework which empowers enforcers to punish non-compliance with fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\nBack in April the Commission opened formal DSA infringement proceedings against Meta, citing a range of election security concerns \u2014 including its plan to depreciate CrowdTangle. The social media monitoring and analytics tool has been used by researchers and journalists to track disinformation on Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram.\nAt the time, the Commission said it was particularly worried about the timing of the CrowdTangle depreciation \u2014 coming just a few weeks ahead of the European Elections.\nThat intervention appears to have led to a brief reprieve for CrowdTangle in the EU. Per the Commission, Meta responded by deploying new functionalities in CrowdTangle at the end of May. These took the form of 27 new public real-time visual dashboards, one per EU Member State, which the EU said was done to \u201callow third party real-time civic discourse and election monitoring during the EU elections.\u201d\nHowever, Meta subsequently discontinued the dashboards when it shuttered access to CrowdTangle itself on August 14.\nMeta\u2019s replacement tools have been criticized by researchers as having a fraction of the utility of CrowdTangle.\nThe EU\u2019s new RFI to Meta asks the company to \u201cprovide information on measures it has taken to comply with its obligations to give researchers access to data that is publicly accessible on the online interface of Facebook and Instagram, as required by the DSA, and on its plans to update its election and civic discourse monitoring functionalities.\u201d\nSpecifically, the Commission said it wants details from Meta about its content library and application programming interface (API) \u2014 including eligibility criteria for access; the application process; the data that can be accessed; and functionalities \u2014 as the bloc looks to assess whether Meta\u2019s alternative meets DSA transparency obligations.\nBoth Facebook and Instagram are designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the DSA, and regulation requires VLOPs to provide external researchers with access to platform data so they can study systemic risks to the EU.\nThe bloc has given Meta until September 6 to provide the requested info. \u201cBased on the assessment of the replies, the Commission will determine the next steps, which could include interim measures, and non-compliance decisions,\u201d it adds, noting it can also choose to accept commitments made by Meta to remedy concerns.\nThe Commission\u2019s wider investigation into Meta\u2019s election security strategy remains ongoing.\nThe back-and-forth around CrowdTangle is a reminder that the impact of the DSA shouldn\u2019t only be measured in headline fines. EU enforcers are applying operational pressure on major platforms through strategic use of a range of enforcement tools \u2014 including opening formal proceedings but also following up with asks for more info, allowing them to respond to new developments.\nHowever, it is also notable that Meta went ahead and discontinued CrowdTangle in the EU in spite of the tool\u2019s demise already being on the radar of DSA enforcers.\n\ntitle2:\nApple reportedly has \u2018several hundred\u2019 working on a robot arm with attached iPad\ndescription2:\nApple is reportedly shifting into the world of home robots after the wheels came off its electric car. According to a new report from Bloomberg, a team of several hundred is working on its potential first product: a robotic arm with an \u201ciPad-like\u201d display attached. The home product would take a page out of Amazon\u2019s dynamic Echo Show 10 and one of Meta\u2019s bygone Portal devices.\nThe product has reportedly been in the works for around two years, though the team has ramped up efforts far more recently. Apple isn\u2019t exactly taking the easy road. As difficult as producing an electric self-driving car would\u2019ve been, the world of home robots is littered with failed projects, with the sole exception of iRobot\u2019s Roomba and subsequent robot vacuums.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle is bringing AI overviews to India, Brazil, Japan, UK, Indonesia and Mexico\ndescription3:\nAfter bringing AI overviews to the U.S., Google is expanding the AI-powered search summaries to six more countries: India, Brazil, Japan, the U.K., Indonesia and Mexico. These markets will also get local language support for AI overviews.\nThe search giant is rethinking how it displays source material links, as well. It\u2019s adding a view on the upper right-hand side showing icons of sites above the AI overview on both desktop and mobile. Users can tap on those icons to go to links cited in an AI overview and read more on the topic.\nImage Credits: Google\nAdditionally, the company is testing a way to display relevant links within the text of AI overviews. Google said that it wants to drive more traffic to external sites.\n\u201cWith AI Overviews, we\u2019re seeing that people have been visiting a greater diversity of websites for help with more complex questions. And when people click from search result pages with AI Overviews, these clicks are higher quality for websites \u2014 meaning users are more likely to spend more time on the sites they visit,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\nAI-powered tools have been criticized for not prominently displaying links to sources while displaying summaries. News outlets have singled out search tools such as Perplexity AI, accusing it of plagiarism and unethical web scraping. Earlier this month, Perplexity\u2019s CBO Dmitry Shevelenko told TechCrunch that a \u201cdouble-digit percentage\u201d of visitors are clicking on external links. Google has yet to publicly release any number about how much traffic its AI-powered search results are driving.\nIndia focus\nGoogle has added some India-focused features to AI overviews with this roll out. The company had previously tested a toggle to let users toggle between Hindi and English results without leaving the page. That feature will also be part of AI overviews.\nVideo Credits: Google\nThe company will also let users in India hear responses generated by tapping the \u201cListen\u201d button. The company mentioned that Indian users listen to AI overview responses more often than users in other countries.\nIn our early testing, we found that some queries in Hindi didn\u2019t work if we switched sentence structure or words. We have asked Google more about its approach for answering questions in Hindi. We\u2019ll update the story if we hear back.\n\ntitle4:\nBritish fintech Revolut valued at $45 billion in secondary share sale\ndescription4:\nRevolut cards are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on March 29, 2024.\nBritish fintech startup Revolut on Friday said it was valued at $45 billion in a secondary share sale with existing and new investors.\n\"This valuation reflects the strong financial performance recorded by the company in recent quarters as well as the progress made in executing its strategic objectives,\" Revolut said in a statement.\nThe round was led by Coatue, D1 Capital Partners and existing investor Tiger Global, the company noted, without disclosing the total value of the shares on sale.\nThe $45 billion transaction sharply increases the company's valuation from the $33 billion notched in July 2021.\n\"We're delighted to provide the opportunity to our employees to realise the benefits of the company's collective success,\" Revolut CEO Nik Storonsky commented. \"We're also excited to partner with several new investors who share our vision as we continue our journey to redefine the banking landscape as we've known it.\"\nThe valuation comes just weeks after Revolut was granted a banking license with restrictions in the U.K., ending a three-year wait after first applying for the license in 2021.\nA series of issues had led to the delays, including Revolut's share structure being inconsistent with the rules set out by the U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority, which has since been resolved.\nThe license allows Revolut to take customer deposits and issue products such as loans and credit cards. The company is now set to build up banking infrastructure in the U.K. before the official launch.\"\n\nResponse:",
