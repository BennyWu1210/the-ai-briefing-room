Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, US, on Wednesday, July 10, 2024.\nPalantir shares closed up 11% on Thursday after the company announced a partnership with Microsoft to sell secure cloud, analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities to the U.S. defense and intelligence communities.\nPalantir, which works closely with governments to provide software to visualize army positions, among other services, will use the partnership to launch its products \u2014 such as Gotham, Foundry, Apollo and AIP \u2014 on Microsoft's cloud products for government agencies.\nPalantir reported earnings earlier in the week, raising its annual revenue forecast to between $2.74 billion and $2.75 billion, from $2.68 billion to $2.69 billion. That was above LSEG consensus estimates of a $2.7 billion forecast.\nCEO Alex Karp said in a letter to shareholders at the time that the company's trailing 12-month revenue in its U.S. government business, which includes intel and defense agencies, surpassed $1 billion for the first time. The company said it earned 54% of its revenue from government clients during the second quarter.\nMicrosoft said the partnership would allow U.S. defense and intelligence organizations to build AI tools for action plans and logistics, among other things.\nPalantir, co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, will work with Microsoft to provide trial services and training sessions.\nPalantir shares are up about 70% year to date.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon is fumbling in India\ndescription2:\n\u201cFounders \u2014 whether it\u2019s Deepinder, Aadit, or Vidit or the team at Flipkart \u2014 have out-executed the management team of Amazon,\u201d an analyst said.\nAbout two years ago, a VC firm was evaluating an investment in a quick-commerce startup in India. The company\u2019s instant delivery model was showing signs of success in the South Asian market, even as many startups in the space were struggling in developed markets.\nBut the firm was wary: Could Amazon swoop in and dominate this nascent sector with its heft, scale and resources? To make sure, a partner at the venture firm then reached out to some of his friends in Amazon\u2019s leadership and walked away with the sense that the e-commerce giant wasn\u2019t planning a quick-commerce offering in India.\nThat decision by Amazon is now looking like a significant misstep. Quick-commerce is increasingly making inroads in India, giving customers access to a range of categories, from grocery to electronics, that they can receive in minutes. The top three quick-commerce firms \u2014 Zomato\u2019s Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy\u2019s Instamart \u2014 are now on track to record annual sales of about $4.5 billion in total. That\u2019s a fourth of Amazon India\u2019s sales, which brokerage firm JM Financial pegs at $18 billion.\nAnd Amazon seems to have ignored this burgeoning market altogether.\nAn opportunity overlooked\nIndia, the world\u2019s most populous nation, is a key overseas market for U.S. tech giants. But despite tens of billions of dollars in investments in the past 15 years or so, the country\u2019s e-commerce market only grew 11% to 12% last year, according to industry estimates. The quick-commerce market, in contrast, is growing at more than 125% \u2014 a lot of that is of course due to that market\u2019s small size, but the opportunity here is hard to overlook.\nThese firms are \u201cclearly taking share\u201d from larger e-commerce companies, said Rahul Malhotra, an e-commerce analyst at Bernstein, adding that it\u2019s raising questions about how traditional e-commerce giants are going to react.\nThe categories these instant commerce firms operate in \u2014 groceries, household and kitchen equipment, electronics, and sometimes even smartphones \u2014 are often some of the biggest traffic and sales drivers for e-commerce businesses, which can then leverage that traffic to cross-sell and upsell other items to those customers, the founder of a leading e-commerce firm told TechCrunch.\nAnd as quick-commerce companies see their sales and market share balloon, they can leverage their newfound heft to secure better deals with different brands. Quick-commerce firms are also changing buying behavior in the top 10 Indian cities, according to surveys by Bank of America and Bernstein.\nAmazon has notably done little to address this opportunity. The company has not launched any quick-commerce offering; instead, it has mocked firms that deliver \u201cquickly\u201d in its advertisements. This stance is looking increasingly out of touch as the market evolves in developing countries like India. Blinkit, which Zomato acquired for less than $600 million in 2022, is now worth more than $13 billion, according to Goldman Sachs. That\u2019s more than half of Amazon India\u2019s estimated worth.\nWalmart-owned Flipkart, Amazon\u2019s chief rival in India, has been quicker to respond, though some would argue it is still a tad late to the game. The company trails Amazon in urban Indian markets, but this week it launched its own quick-commerce offering, called Flipkart Minutes. The move is being seen as a strategic play to win over Amazon India\u2019s urban customers.\nAnalysts feel Amazon\u2019s decision to not innovate quickly in this sector is only one of a series of fumbles in India. The company has been losing market share in the country for more than three years \u2014 a trend that has come into sharp focus following the abrupt resignation of Amazon India\u2019s head, Manish Tiwary, earlier this week.\nAmazon has not been able to capitalize on white spaces across quick commerce, tier 2 markets and categories like apparel, Malhotra told TechCrunch.\nMeesho, a social commerce platform backed by SoftBank and Prosus, has made deep inroads in smaller Indian cities and towns over just a few years. The firm now commands greater market share in the mobile app space than Amazon does in India, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note this week. Flipkart\u2019s apps have more than 50 million daily active users in India, whereas Amazon has fewer than 40 million, according to Bank of America analysts.\nE-commerce growth in India is increasingly driven by smaller cities, with 80% of Meesho\u2019s customers coming from tier 2 and beyond, the startup said in a report Thursday. Tier 2+ cities outpaced larger urban centers in electronic accessory purchases for the firm, the report added.\nA matter of priorities\nIndustry executives familiar with Amazon\u2019s internal workings suggest that the e-commerce giant has changed its strategy in India. Under Andy Jassy\u2019s leadership, the firm appears to be prioritizing its cloud business.\nThis shift was somewhat publicly justified when Jassy said last year that Amazon would invest $15 billion in the country by 2030 \u2014 of that sum, $12.7 billion, is earmarked for AWS operations and expansions. In contrast, Walmart and Flipkart are pouring more than $1 billion into their e-commerce operations in India each year.\nAmazon has also struggled with the slow pace of merchant adoption in the country, despite putting hundreds of millions into that strategy, an analyst said. This limited pool of potential sellers restricts the growth and scalability of Amazon\u2019s platform in a country with a large population and diverse consumer demands.\nThe last five years for the firm have been remarkably difficult for other reasons, too. The Indian government added stringent restrictions on how e-commerce firms operate in 2019, forcing Amazon to rework how it did business with sellers. Reuters reported in 2021 that Amazon was giving preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresenting its ties with those sellers and using them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country. (Amazon said at the time that Reuters\u2019 reporting appeared to have relied on unsubstantiated, incomplete, and/or factually incorrect information.) Then the firm lost a high-profile battle to acquire Future Group, which was India\u2019s second-largest retail chain at the time, to Reliance.\nThat episode prompted Bernstein to say at the time that Amazon was facing an \u201cunfavorable\u201d regulatory environment in India.\nBut Malhotra, who authored that aforementioned report, now feels regulatory setbacks can\u2019t be the only reason for Amazon\u2019s struggles in the country. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been strategic enough. And founders \u2014 whether it\u2019s Deepinder (Zomato), Aadit (Zepto), or Vidit (Meesho) or the team at Flipkart \u2014 have out-executed the management team [of Amazon],\u201d he added.\nThat\u2019s not to say that Amazon hasn\u2019t tried to scale and expand. The firm is still trying to make a dent in the mobile payments market in India with its Amazon Pay product, and it has also tried its hand at food delivery but ended up shutting that venture down. The company also closed its wholesale distribution business as well as its foray into online education in the country.\nAmazon is also increasingly trying to serve more Amazon Fresh customers within two to three hours and continues to maintain a QVC-style shopping experience it launched on the app last year.\nBut an analyst, who didn\u2019t wish to be quoted, said he was skeptical of Amazon\u2019s ability to bounce back as the firm, which is still lossmaking in India, has already spent too much capital building a certain kind of supply-chain system that can\u2019t be molded overnight to meet the consumer\u2019s changing shopping habits.\nAsked to comment on its sales figure, an Amazon spokesperson instead claimed that the company\u2019s data and external reports showed that Amazon.in is India\u2019s \u201cmost trusted online shopping destination.\u201d And that the information \u201cshared by TechCrunch was factually incorrect and uncorroborated,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon's investment in AI firm Anthropic faces UK merger investigation\ndescription3:\nIn this article AMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nDario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. Chesnot | Getty Images\nLONDON \u2014 E-commerce giant Amazon's multibillion-dollar investment in the U.S. artificial intelligence firm Anthropic is formally being investigated by a U.K. competition regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority said Thursday that it has begun a \"Phase 1\" investigation into Amazon's investment and partnership with Anthropic to assess whether the deal has resulted in a relevant merger situation that may harm competition in the U.K. Following initial scrutiny into the Amazon-Anthropic partnership, the CMA now has \"sufficient information\" in relation to the tie-up to begin a formal probe, the regulator said in a notice on its website. The CMA now has up to 40 working days to decide whether the transaction could harm competition and should therefore be scrutinized further in an in-depth \"Phase 2\" investigation. Amazon completed in March a $4 billion investment in Anthropic. The deal consisted of an initial $1.25 billion equity stake in September, followed by a further $2.75 billion transaction finalized earlier this year.\nAs part of the deal Amazon will make Anthropic's powerful large language models available on its Bedrock platform for building generative AI applications. Anthropic's models will also be trained and deployed on Amazon's own custom AI chips, which were built by its Amazon Web Services cloud computing division. In a statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is \"disappointed\" the CMA proceeded with an initial Phase 1 merger probe, adding that its collaboration with Anthropic \"does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for review.\" \"By investing in Anthropic, Amazon, along with other companies, is helping Anthropic expand choice and competition in this important technology. Amazon holds no board seat nor decision-making power at Anthropic, and Anthropic is free to work with any other provider (and indeed has multiple partners),\" the spokesperson said via email. Amazon's spokesperson added that the company will continue to make Anthropic's models available to customers via Bedrock. An Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC: \"We are an independent company. Our strategic partnerships and investor relationships do not diminish our corporate governance independence or our freedom to partner with others.\" \"Amazon does not have a seat on Anthropic's board, nor does it have any board observer rights,\" the Anthropic spokesperson added. \"We welcome the opportunity to cooperate with the CMA and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of Amazon's investment and our commercial collaboration.\"\nwatch now\nThe Amazon-Anthropic pact is not the only deal facing scrutiny from regulators in the U.K. The CMA is separately scrutinizing U.S. software giant Microsoft 's multibillion-dollar partnership and investment in AI giant OpenAI. However, the watchdog is yet to reveal whether it will begin a Phase 1 investigation into the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. Stateside, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January sent orders to tech giants Microsoft , Amazon and Google , along with AI firms OpenAI and Anthropic, requiring them to share information about their respective recent investments and partnerships.\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday.

The aim was to identify flaws that could be used to unmask information about the gangs themselves, including their victims.\nStykas told TechCrunch ahead of his talk at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Thursday that he found several simple vulnerabilities in the web dashboards used by at least three ransomware gangs, which were enough to compromise the inner workings of the operations themselves.\nRansomware gangs typically hide their identities and operations on the dark web, an anonymous version of the web accessible through the Tor browser, which makes it difficult to identify where the real-world servers are that are used for cyberattacks and storage of stolen data.\nBut coding errors and security bugs in the leak sites, which ransomware gangs use to extort their victims by publishing their stolen files, allowed Stykas to peek inside without having to log in and extract information about each operation. In some cases, the bugs exposed the IP addresses of the leak site\u2019s servers, which could be used to trace their real-world locations.\nSome of the bugs include the Everest ransomware gang using a default password for accessing its back-end SQL databases, and exposing its file directories, and exposed API endpoints that revealed the targets of the BlackCat ransomware gang\u2019s attacks while in progress.\nStykas said he also used one bug, known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, to cycle through all of the chat messages of a Mallox ransomware administrator, which contained two decryption keys that Stykas then shared with the affected companies.\nThe researcher told TechCrunch that two of the victims were small businesses and the other four were crypto companies, with two of them considered unicorns (startups with valuations over $1 billion), though he declined to name the companies.\nHe added that none of the companies he notified has publicly disclosed the security incidents, and did not rule out disclosing the names of the companies in the future.\nThe FBI and other government authorities have long advocated victims of ransomware not to pay the hackers\u2019 ransom, as to prevent the malicious actors from profiting from their cyberattacks. But the advice offers little by way of recourse for the companies that need to regain access to their data or can\u2019t operate their business.\nLaw enforcement has seen some success in compromising ransomware gangs in order to obtain their bank of decryption keys and starve cybercriminals from their illegal revenue streams, albeit with mixed results.\nThe research shows that ransomware gangs can be susceptible to much of the same simple security issues as big companies, providing a potential avenue for law enforcement to target criminal hackers that are far out of jurisdictional reach.\"\n\nResponse:",
