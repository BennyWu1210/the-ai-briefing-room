Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple , which will launch its AI on iPhones, Macs and iPads later this year. Google doesn't make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the company's Gemini AI subscription program. \"We've completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person,\" said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post. \"It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks.\" \"Starting today, you can bring up Gemini's overlay on top of the app you're using to ask questions about what's on your screen,\" Samat wrote. It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, according to Google. Google previously had some AI features in Android, but this is the first year it's heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devices. One example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free, after which Gemini checks Google Calendar. If the user has availability in their schedule, Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that night.\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\nThe assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google apps. \"For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainer's email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio,\" the company stated in its blog post. The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and \"create an image of a cake for someone who loves space,\" which the assistant can create and attach to the email. Or, in YouTube, a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a video. You can ask about what's on your phone screen in other apps, too, like Maps, Flights and Gmail. Google said it's working to add support for third-party extensions, which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps later. Gemini's assistant has a range of voices. A user can have a human-like conversation through its Gemini \"Live\" feature, which the company first announced at its May developer conference. \"Live\" will initially be available for select devices and subscribers to Google's Gemini Advanced program, which costs $19.99 per month. In June, Apple announced its long-awaited artificial intelligence push, Apple Intelligence, that can do tasks like recognize notifications important to personal context, and do cross-application tasking as well as letting Siri tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT when needed for tasks such as its writing tools and creating images. Apple's system is currently in testing. Some early features will launch this fall alongside new iPhones, but the bulk of the system won't be released until next year.\nNew Pixel 9 phones and Pixel Watch 3\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 9 phones are the first to get Satellite SOS for Android\ndescription1:\nGoogle is following Apple in launching a way to use your phone to communicate via a satellite in an emergency. During its big Pixel 9 reveal event on Tuesday, the company shared details of Satellite SOS, which will let you contact emergency responders and share your location when you don\u2019t have cellular service.\nThe new Pixel 9 lineup will be the first Android phones to be able to use Satellite SOS, Google\u2019s Brian Rakowski said onstage. (Google partnered with Skylo on the feature.) The feature launches first in the US \u201cregardless of your carrier plan,\u201d Rakowski said, though it won\u2019t be available in Hawaii and Alaska, per a support page. According to fine print shown during Google\u2019s livestream, the service will be included \u201cat no additional charge for the first two years after activation of devices.\u201d\nA blog post by Rakowski qualifies that further, saying that it will be free for those first two years \u201con Pixel.\u201d And it\u2019s unclear when the feature might arrive for other Android phones. Still, it\u2019s nice to see Google introduce this feature for Android, especially following Qualcomm\u2019s failed attempt to launch a satellite SOS feature of its own.\nApple launched its satellite service, Emergency SOS, in November 2022. It announced last year that iPhone 14 owners would get an additional year of free coverage, meaning that both iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users will have to decide if they want to pay for the service starting in November 2025.\nUpdate, August 13th: Added details about the Skylo partnership and two states where Satellite SOS won\u2019t work.\n\ntitle2:\nUS appeals court rules geofence warrants are unconstitutional\ndescription2:\nA federal appeals court has ruled that geofence warrants are unconstitutional, a decision that will limit the use of the controversial search warrants across several U.S. states.\nThe Friday ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which covers Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, found that geofence warrants are \u201ccategorically prohibited by the Fourth Amendment,\u201d which protects against unwarranted searches and seizures.\nCivil liberties and privacy advocates applauded the ruling, which effectively makes the use of geofence warrants unlawful across the three U.S. states for now.\nGeofence warrants, also known as \u201creverse\u201d search warrants, allow police to draw a shape on a map, such as over a crime scene, and demand that Google (or any other company that collects user locations) search its entire banks of location data for any phone or device that was in that area at a specific point in time.\nBut critics have long argued that geofence warrants are unconstitutional because they can be overbroad and include information on entirely innocent people.\nThe court case centers on an armed robbery of a U.S. Postal Service worker in Mississippi in February 2018, in which police used a geofence warrant to identify the individuals suspected of the robbery.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion comes to a different conclusion than a similar case heard last month in the Fourth Circuit, which covers North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. That ruling found that accessing Google\u2019s stores of location data does not count as a search and upheld the legality of geofence warrants across those states.\nIn its case, the Fifth Circuit disagreed and found that police seeking data from Google\u2019s vast stores of location data for a criminal suspect does in fact constitute a search. But because the bank of data is so big, and because the entire database has to be scanned, the court ruled that there is no legal authority capable of authorizing a search, per a blog post by law professor Orin Kerr analyzing the ruling.\nThe court said in its ruling, its emphasis included: \u201cThis search is occurring while law enforcement officials have no idea who they are looking for, or whether the search will even turn up a result. Indeed, the quintessential problem with these warrants is that they never include a specific user to be identified, only a temporal and geographic location where any given user may turn up post-search. That is constitutionally insufficient.\u201d\nWhile the Fifth Circuit ruled that geofence warrants are unconstitutional, the court concluded that the police department had acted in good faith when seeking the warrant for the location data held by Google, and upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction. The court said, in part because the use of geofence warrants were novel at the time and the department asked other agencies for legal guidance prior to submitting the warrant, the evidence should not be suppressed in this case.\nKerr, in his analysis, said the ruling \u201craises questions of whether any digital warrants for online contents are constitutional.\u201d\nBecause tech companies, like Google, Uber, Snap and others, collect and store huge amounts of its users\u2019 location data and histories on its servers, this data can be obtained by law enforcement; if the data didn\u2019t exist, the problem would be moot. The use of geofence warrants has rocketed in recent years, at one point amounting to about one-quarter of all U.S. legal demands the company received.\nGoogle said late last year that it would begin storing users\u2019 location data on their devices, making geofence warrants less useful for law enforcement.\n\ntitle3:\nChinese robotaxi startup WeRide gets approval to carry passengers in California\ndescription3:\nChinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide has received the green light to test its driverless vehicles with passengers in California.\nThe step comes as WeRide begins the process to go public on the U.S. stock market at a nearly $5 billion valuation. The timing also coincides with reports that the Commerce Department is considering a ban on Chinese connected vehicles \u2014 which include autonomous vehicles \u2014 due to national security concerns.\nAs of August 2, WeRide holds two permits from the California Public Utilities Commission: A drivered pilot permit and a driverless pilot permit. Both allow WeRide to test its vehicles on public roads while carrying passengers \u2014 the former with a human safety driver behind the wheel, and the latter without one. The permits do not yet allow WeRide to charge passengers for rides, and the service isn\u2019t available to the general public.\nWeRide did not respond to requests for further details, including whether it has started transporting passengers in its autonomous vehicles. A spokesperson from the CPUC told TechCrunch WeRide is permitted to test in San Jose and nearby areas, and that the company has 12 active vehicles on its equipment list today.\nWeRide has been testing its vehicles autonomously without passengers on public roads in San Jose since 2021 after receiving permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.\nThe company\u2019s rollout in California has been slow. In 2023, WeRide\u2019s vehicles drove just 42,391 miles autonomously in the state, per DMV data. By comparison, Waymo drove over 9 million autonomous miles.\nWeRide has shared little about its plans for commercializing in California. Its CPUC permit notes that WeRide is \u201climited to the use of vehicles seating fewer than 16 people, including the driver.\u201d This stipulation \u2014 which isn\u2019t in Waymo\u2019s, Cruise\u2019s or Zoox\u2019s permits \u2014 could be in regards to WeRide\u2019s different vehicle types. In addition to a robotaxi, WeRide has also built a robobus, which seats up to 10 passengers.\nWeRide touts itself as the first autonomous driving company in the world that is operating and testing in 30 cities across seven countries. The startup holds permits to drive autonomously on public roads in four countries: China, Singapore, the UAE and the U.S. Aside from its robotaxi and robobus, WeRide is also working on a robovan (for goods delivery), a robotic street sweeper and ADAS for OEMs.\n\ntitle4:\nCalifornia AI bill SB 1047 aims to prevent AI disasters, but Silicon Valley warns it will cause one\ndescription4:\nOutside of sci-fi films, there\u2019s no precedent for AI systems killing people or being used in cyberattacks. However, some lawmakers want to implement safeguards before bad actors make that dystopian future a reality. A California bill, known as SB 1047, tries to stop real-world disasters caused by AI systems before they happen, and it\u2019s headed for a final vote in the state\u2019s senate later in August.\nWhile this seems like a goal we can all agree on, SB 1047 has drawn the ire of Silicon Valley players large and small, including venture capitalists, big tech trade groups, researchers and startup founders. A lot of AI bills are flying around the country right now, but California\u2019s Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act has become one of the most controversial. Here\u2019s why.\nWhat does SB 1047 do?\nSB 1047 tries to prevent large AI models from being used to cause \u201ccritical harms\u201d against humanity.\nThe bill gives examples of \u201ccritical harms\u201d as a bad actor using an AI model to create a weapon that results in mass casualties, or instructing one to orchestrate a cyberattack causing more than $500 million in damages (for comparison, the CrowdStrike outage is estimated to have caused upwards of $5 billion). The bill makes developers \u2014 that is, the companies that develop the models \u2014 liable for implementing sufficient safety protocols to prevent outcomes like these.\nWhat models and companies are subject to these rules?\nSB 1047\u2019s rules would only apply to the world\u2019s largest AI models: ones that cost at least $100 million and use 10^26 FLOPS during training \u2014 a huge amount of compute, but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said GPT-4 cost about this much to train. These thresholds could be raised as needed.\nVery few companies today have developed public AI products large enough to meet those requirements, but tech giants such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are likely to very soon. AI models \u2014 essentially, massive statistical engines that identify and predict patterns in data \u2014 have generally become more accurate as they\u2019ve grown larger, a trend many expect to continue. Mark Zuckerberg recently said the next generation of Meta\u2019s Llama will require 10x more compute, which would put it under the authority of SB 1047.\nWhen it comes to open source models and their derivatives, the bill determined that once $25 million is spent on developing or fine tuning by another party, they become responsible for that derivative model, rather than the original developer.\nThe bill also requires a safety protocol to prevent misuses of covered AI products, including an \u201cemergency stop\u201d button that shuts down the entire AI model. Developers must also create testing procedures that address risks posed by AI models, and must hire third-party auditors annually to assess their AI safety practices.\nThe result must be \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that following these protocols will prevent critical harms \u2014 not absolute certainty, which is of course impossible to provide.\nWho would enforce it, and how?\nA new California agency, the Frontier Model Division (FMD), would oversee the rules. Every new public AI model that meets SB 1047\u2019s thresholds must be individually certified with a written copy of its safety protocol.\nThe FMD would be governed by a five-person board, including representatives from the AI industry, open source community and academia, appointed by California\u2019s governor and legislature. The board will advise California\u2019s attorney general on potential violations of SB 1047, and issue guidance to AI model developers on safety practices.\nA developer\u2019s chief technology officer must submit an annual certification to the FMD assessing its AI model\u2019s potential risks, how effective its safety protocol is and a description of how the company is complying with SB 1047. Similar to breach notifications, if an \u201cAI safety incident\u201d occurs, the developer must report it to the FMD within 72 hours of learning about the incident.\nIf a developer fails to comply with any of these provisions, SB 1047 allows California\u2019s attorney general to bring a civil action against the developer. For a model costing $100 million to train, penalties could reach up to $10 million on the first violation and $30 million on subsequent violations. That penalty rate scales as AI models become more expensive.\nLastly, the bill includes whistleblower protections for employees if they try to disclose information about an unsafe AI model to California\u2019s attorney general.\nWhat do proponents say?\nCalifornia State Senator Scott Wiener, who authored the bill and represents San Francisco, tells TechCrunch that SB 1047 is an attempt to learn from past policy failures with social media and data privacy, and protect citizens before it\u2019s too late.\n\u201cWe have a history with technology of waiting for harms to happen, and then wringing our hands,\u201d said Wiener. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait for something bad to happen. Let\u2019s just get out ahead of it.\u201d\nEven if a company trains a $100 million model in Texas, or for that matter France, it will be covered by SB 1047 as long as it does business in California. Wiener says Congress has done \u201cremarkably little legislating around technology over the last quarter century,\u201d so he thinks it\u2019s up to California to set a precedent here.\nWhen asked whether he\u2019s met with OpenAI and Meta on SB 1047, Wiener says \u201cwe\u2019ve met with all the large labs.\u201d\nTwo AI researchers who are sometimes called the \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have thrown their support behind this bill. These two belong to a faction of the AI community concerned about the dangerous, doomsday scenarios that AI technology could cause. These \u201cAI doomers\u201d have existed for a while in the research world, and SB 1047 could codify some of their preferred safeguards into law. Another group sponsoring SB 1047, the Center for AI Safety, wrote an open letter in May 2023 asking the world to prioritize \u201cmitigating the risk of extinction from AI\u201d as seriously as pandemics or nuclear war.\n\u201cThis is in the long-term interest of industry in California and the US more generally because a major safety incident would likely be the biggest roadblock to further advancement,\u201d said director of the Center for AI Safety, Dan Hendrycks, in an email to TechCrunch.\nRecently, Hendrycks\u2019 own motivations have been called into question. In July, he publicly launched a startup, Gray Swan, which builds \u201ctools to help companies assess the risks of their AI systems,\u201d according to a press release. Following criticisms that Hendrycks\u2019 startup could stand to gain if the bill passes, potentially as one of the auditors SB 1047 requires developers to hire, he divested his equity stake in Gray Swan.\n\u201cI divested in order to send a clear signal,\u201d said Hendrycks in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cIf the billionaire VC opposition to commonsense AI safety wants to show their motives are pure, let them follow suit.\u201d\nWhat do opponents say?\nA growing chorus of Silicon Valley players oppose SB 1047.\nHendrycks\u2019 \u201cbillionaire VC opposition\u201d likely refers to a16z, the venture firm founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, which has strongly opposed SB 1047. In early August, the venture firm\u2019s chief legal officer, Jaikumar Ramaswamy, submitted a letter to Senator Wiener, claiming the bill \u201cwill burden startups because of its arbitrary and shifting thresholds,\u201d creating a chilling effect on the AI ecosystem. As AI technology advances, it will get more expensive, meaning that more startups will cross that $100 million threshold and will be covered by SB 1047; a16z says several of their startups already receive that much for training models.\nFei-Fei Li, often called the godmother of AI, broke her silence on SB 1047 in early August, writing in a Fortune column that the bill will \u201charm our budding AI ecosystem.\u201d While Li is a well-regarded pioneer in AI research from Stanford, she also reportedly created an AI startup called World Labs in April, valued at a billion dollars and backed by a16z.\nShe joins influential AI academics such as fellow Stanford researcher Andrew Ng, who called the bill \u201can assault on open source\u201d during a speech at a Y Combinator event in July. Open source models may create additional risk to their creators, since like any open software, they are more easily modified and deployed to arbitrary and potentially malicious purposes.\nMeta\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, said SB 1047 would hurt research efforts, and is based on an \u201cillusion of \u2018existential risk\u2019 pushed by a handful of delusional think-tanks,\u201d in a post on X. Meta\u2019s Llama LLM is one of the foremost examples of an open source LLM.\nStartups are also not happy about the bill. Jeremy Nixon, CEO of AI startup Omniscience and founder of AGI House SF, a hub for AI startups in San Francisco, worries that SB 1047 will crush his ecosystem. He argues that bad actors should be punished for causing critical harms, not the AI labs that openly develop and distribute the technology.\n\u201cThere is a deep confusion at the center of the bill, that LLMs can somehow differ in their levels of hazardous capability,\u201d said Nixon. \u201cIt\u2019s more than likely, in my mind, that all models have hazardous capabilities as defined by the bill.\u201d\nBut Big Tech, which the bill directly focuses on, is panicked about SB 1047 as well. The Chamber of Progress \u2014 a trade group representing Google, Apple, Amazon and other Big Tech giants \u2014 issued an open letter opposing the bill saying SB 1047 restrains free speech and \u201cpushes tech innovation out of California.\u201d Last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other tech executives endorsed the idea of federal AI regulation.\nU.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, released a statement opposing SB 1047 on Tuesday. He expressed concerns the bill \u201cwould be ineffective, punishing of individual entrepreneurs and small businesses, and hurt California\u2019s spirit of innovation.\u201d\nSilicon Valley doesn\u2019t traditionally like when California sets broad tech regulation like this. In 2019, Big Tech pulled a similar card when another state privacy bill, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act, also threatened to change the tech landscape. Silicon Valley lobbied against that bill, and months before it went into effect, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and 50 other executives wrote an open letter calling for a federal privacy bill instead.\nWhat happens next?\nOn August 15, SB 1047 will be sent to the California Senate\u2019s Assembly floor with whatever amendments get approved. That\u2019s where bills \u201clive or die\u201d in California\u2019s Senate, according to Wiener. It\u2019s expected to pass, given its overwhelming support from lawmakers thus far.\nAnthropic submitted a number of suggested amendments to SB 1047 in late July, which Wiener says he and California\u2019s Senate policy committees are actively considering. Anthropic is the first developer of a state-of-the-art AI model to publicly signal it\u2019s willing to work with Wiener on SB 1047, even though it doesn\u2019t support the bill as it stands. This was largely seen as a win for the bill.\nAnthropic\u2019s proposed changes include getting rid of the FMD, reducing the Attorney General\u2019s power to sue AI developers before a harm occurs, and getting rid of the whistleblower protections provision in SB 1047. Wiener says he\u2019s generally positive about the amendments, but needs approval from several Senate policy committees before adding them to the bill.\nIf SB 1047 passes the Senate, the bill will be sent to California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk where he will ultimately decide whether to sign the bill into law before the end of August. Wiener says he has not spoken to Newsom about the bill, and does not know his position.\nThis bill would not go into effect immediately, as the FMD is set to be formed in 2026. Further, if the bill does pass, it\u2019s very likely to face legal challenges before then, perhaps from some of the same groups that are speaking up about it now.\"\n\nResponse:",
