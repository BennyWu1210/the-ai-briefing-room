Indeed, among a sea of new hardware came an intriguing software update to one already on the market: the AirPods Pro 2.\nApple announced that its most premium earbuds would double as an over-the-counter hearing aid, courtesy of a software update, pending approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe FDA on Thursday announced that it has granted what it calls \u201cthe first over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid software device, Hearing Aid Feature.\u201d Specifically, it has approved the software update that enables that functionality.\n\u201cHearing loss is a significant public health issue impacting millions of Americans,\u201d the FDA\u2019s Michelle Tarver notes in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s marketing authorization of an over-the-counter hearing aid software on a widely used consumer audio product is another step that advances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.\u201d\nThe news was made possible in part by the FDA\u2019s October 2022 move to allow for the sale of hearing aids without a prescription. That move has given rise to a new industry of more easily accessible hearing devices.\nEarlier this week, TechCrunch went hands-on with a demo version of Apple\u2019s new hearing test. The feature will be accessible via settings in iOS 18 when a pair of AirPods 2 are connected. Users will have to receive a result of mild to moderate hearing loss in order to take advantage of the new feature. Alternately, they can also upload test results from a doctor.\nThe hearing aid functions by adjusting different frequency levels, in order to amplify key sounds such as the human voice.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI unveils o1, a model that can fact-check itself\ndescription1:\nChatGPT maker OpenAI has announced its next major product release: A generative AI model code-named Strawberry, officially called OpenAI o1.\nTo be more precise, o1 is actually a family of models. Two are available Thursday in ChatGPT and via OpenAI\u2019s API: o1-preview and o1-mini, a smaller, more efficient model aimed at code generation.\nYou\u2019ll have to be subscribed to ChatGPT Plus or Team to see o1 in the ChatGPT client. Enterprise and educational users will get access early next week.\nNote that the o1 chatbot experience is fairly barebones at present. Unlike GPT-4o, o1\u2019s forebear, o1 can\u2019t browse the web or analyze files yet. The model does have image-analyzing features, but they\u2019ve been disabled pending additional testing. And o1 is rate-limited; weekly limits are currently 30 messages for o1-preview and 50 for o1-mini.\nIn another downside, o1 is expensive. Very expensive. In the API, o1-preview is $15 per 1 million input tokens and $60 per 1 million output tokens. That\u2019s 3x the cost versus GPT-4o for input and 4x the cost for output. (Tokens are bits of raw data; 1 million is equivalent to around 750,000 words.)\nOpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all free users of ChatGPT but hasn\u2019t set a release date. We\u2019ll hold the company to it.\nChain of reasoning\nOpenAI o1 avoids some of the reasoning pitfalls that normally trip up generative AI models because it can effectively fact-check itself by spending more time considering all parts of a question. What makes o1 \u201cfeel\u201d qualitatively different from other generative AI models is its ability to \u201cthink\u201d before responding to queries, according to OpenAI.\nWhen given additional time to \u201cthink,\u201d o1 can reason through a task holistically \u2014 planning ahead and performing a series of actions over an extended period of time that help the model arrive at an answer. This makes o1 well-suited for tasks that require synthesizing the results of multiple subtasks, like detecting privileged emails in an attorney\u2019s inbox or brainstorming a product marketing strategy.\nIn a series of posts on X on Thursday, Noam Brown, a research scientist at OpenAI, said that \u201co1 is trained with reinforcement learning.\u201d This teaches the system \u201cto \u2018think\u2019 before responding via a private chain of thought\u201d through rewards when o1 gets answers right and penalties when it does not, he said.\nBrown added that OpenAI used a new optimization algorithm and training dataset containing \u201creasoning data\u201d and scientific literature specifically tailored for reasoning tasks. \u201cThe longer [o1] thinks, the better it does,\u201d he said.\nImage Credits: OpenAI\nTechCrunch wasn\u2019t offered the opportunity to test o1 before its debut; we\u2019ll get our hands on it as soon as possible. But according to a person who did have access \u2014 Pablo Arredondo, VP at Thomson Reuters \u2014 o1 is better than OpenAI\u2019s previous models (e.g., GPT-4o) at things like analyzing legal briefs and identifying solutions to problems in LSAT logic games.\n\u201cWe saw it tackling more substantive, multi-faceted, analysis,\u201d Arredondo told TechCrunch. \u201cOur automated testing also showed gains against a wide range of simple tasks.\u201d\nIn a qualifying exam for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a high school math competition, o1 correctly solved 83% of problems while GPT-4o only solved 13%, according to OpenAI. (That\u2019s less impressive when you consider that Google DeepMind\u2019s recent AI achieved a silver medal in an equivalent to the actual IMO contest.) OpenAI also says that o1 reached the 89th percentile of participants \u2014 better than DeepMind\u2019s flagship system AlphaCode 2, for what it\u2019s worth \u2014 in the online programming challenge rounds known as Codeforces.\nImage Credits: OpenAI\nIn general, o1 should perform better on problems in data analysis, science, and coding, OpenAI says. (GitHub, which tested o1 with its AI coding assistant GitHub Copilot, reports that the model is adept at optimizing algorithms and app code.) And, at least per OpenAI\u2019s benchmarking, o1 improves over GPT-4o in its multilingual skills, especially in languages like Arabic and Korean.\nEthan Mollick, a professor of management at Wharton, wrote his impressions of o1 after using it for a month in a post on his personal blog. On a challenging crossword puzzle, o1 did well, he said \u2014 getting all the answers correct (despite hallucinating a new clue).\nOpenAI o1 is not perfect\nNow, there are drawbacks.\nOpenAI o1 can be slower than other models, depending on the query. Arredondo says o1 can take over 10 seconds to answer some questions; it shows its progress by displaying a label for the current subtask it\u2019s performing.\nGiven the unpredictable nature of generative AI models, o1 likely has other flaws and limitations. Brown admitted that o1 trips up on games of tic-tac-toe from time to time, for example. And in a technical paper, OpenAI said that it\u2019s heard anecdotal feedback from testers that o1 tends to hallucinate (i.e., confidently make stuff up) more than GPT-4o \u2014 and less often admits when it doesn\u2019t have the answer to a question.\n\u201cErrors and hallucinations still happen [with o1],\u201d Mollick writes in his post. \u201cIt still isn\u2019t flawless.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll no doubt learn more about the various issues in time, and once we have a chance to put o1 through the wringer ourselves.\nFierce competition\nWe\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t point out that OpenAI is far from the only AI vendor investigating these types of reasoning methods to improve model factuality.\nGoogle DeepMind researchers recently published a study showing that by essentially giving models more compute time and guidance to fulfill requests as they\u2019re made, the performance of those models can be significantly improved without any additional tweaks.\nIllustrating the fierceness of the competition, OpenAI said that it decided against showing o1\u2019s raw \u201cchains of thoughts\u201d in ChatGPT partly due to \u201ccompetitive advantage.\u201d (Instead, the company opted to show \u201cmodel-generated summaries\u201d of the chains.)\nOpenAI might be first out of the gate with o1. But assuming rivals soon follow suit with similar models, the company\u2019s real test will be making o1 widely available \u2014 and for cheaper.\nFrom there, we\u2019ll see how quickly OpenAI can deliver upgraded versions of o1. The company says it aims to experiment with o1 models that reason for hours, days, or even weeks to further boost their reasoning capabilities.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta, Snap, and TikTok partner to stop the spread of suicide and self-harm content\ndescription2:\nMeta, Snap, and TikTok have founded a new program called Thrive to help stop the spread of graphic content depicting or encouraging self-harm and suicide. Thrive enables participating companies to share \u201csignals\u201d to alert each other of violating content on their platforms.\nThrive is built in conjunction with the Mental Health Coalition, a charitable organization that says it works to remove the stigma around mental health discussions. Meta says it provides the technical infrastructure behind Thrive that enables \u201csignals to be shared securely.\u201d It uses the same cross-platform signal sharing tech used in the Lantern program, which is designed to help fight child abuse online. Participating companies can share hashes that match the violating media to signal it to each other.\nMeta says it\u2019s already made such content harder to find on its platform but that it\u2019s trying to leave room for people to discuss their mental health, suicide, and self-harm stories, as long as they aren\u2019t promoting it or providing graphic descriptions.\nAccording to Meta\u2019s charts, the company takes action on millions of pieces of suicide and self-harm content every quarter. Last quarter, it restored an estimated 25,000 of those posts, most of them after a user appealed.\n\ntitle3:\nPolaris Dawn astronauts perform historic private spacewalk while wearing SpaceX-made suits\ndescription3:\nA crew of four private astronauts made history in the early hours of Thursday when they opened the hatch of their SpaceX Dragon capsule and conducted the first commercial spacewalk.\nThe spacewalk, the riskiest part of the five-day Polaris Dawn mission, kicked off at 6:12 a.m. ET when oxygen started flowing into the astronauts\u2019 spacesuits. Only two of the four crew members actually exited the vehicle, but all four had to don the new SpaceX-made suits because the Dragon capsule doesn\u2019t have an airlock. That meant the entire spacecraft had to be depressurized.\nA spacewalk \u2014 sometimes called extravehicular activity \u2014 is when astronauts leave the relative safety of their spacecraft for the vacuum of space. In the history of human spaceflight, spacewalks have only ever been performed by government astronauts, who use them as an opportunity to do repairs, perform maintenance, or to conduct scientific experiments. Spacewalks performed by NASA astronauts typically last between five and eight hours.\nBillionaire entrepreneur and mission leader Jared Isaacman was the first to exit the Dragon capsule; after he returned, SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis took a turn in the vacuum of space. They used a special ladder mobility aid dubbed a \u201cskywalker,\u201d which SpaceX added to the Dragon just for this purpose, to assist them outside the capsule. The pair was connected to the spacecraft by umbilical cords and they kept contact with the ladder at all times. The spacewalk was very quick, with each person outside the spacecraft for less than ten minutes. During that time, Isaacman and Gillis performed a series of movements to test the suits\u2019 mobility and performance.\n\u201cBack at home, we all have a lot of work to do, but from here \u2014 looks like a perfect world,\u201d Isaacman said.\nhttps://twitter.com/PolarisProgram/status/1834210476156129761\nSpaceX\u2019s spacesuits are noticeably lighter than the hulking white suits worn by NASA astronauts, and the company said they were designed with \u201cmobility in mind.\u201d\nOne of the biggest differences between NASA spacesuits and the ones designed by SpaceX is the lack of the bulky white backpack, called a Primary Life Support System. Instead of a backpack, the major life support systems are supplied through the 12-foot umbilical cord that\u2019s connected to the spacecraft.\nWhile the pair took their turns outside the craft, the remaining crewmates, former U.S. Air Force pilot Scott \u201cKidd\u201d Poteet and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon, monitored their progress carefully. After Gillis closed the hatch, the spacecraft was gradually repressurized. The entire operation took less than two hours.\nThis remarkable achievement is a huge boon for SpaceX\u2019s private spaceflight ambitions, which most famously include a private crewed mission to Mars. If SpaceX can pull it off, the suits worn by humans traveling to the Red Planet will likely have their origins in the spacesuits worn by Isaacman and his crewmates on Polaris Dawn.\n\u201cWhile Polaris Dawn will be the first time the SpaceX EVA suit is used in low-Earth orbit, the suit\u2019s ultimate destiny lies much farther from our home planet,\u201d the company said back in May. \u201cBuilding a base on the Moon and a city on Mars will require the development of a scalable design for the millions of spacesuits required to help make life multi-planetary.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first milestone in the Polaris Dawn mission. After lifting off early Tuesday morning on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the capsule fired its thrusters to propel the crew to a high point of 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) \u2014 higher than any humans have traveled since the Apollo 17 mission to the moon in 1972.\nNow that the two major milestones are behind them, the Polaris Dawn crew will spend their remaining days in orbit conducting a slew of science experiments and continued testing of laser communications between the capsule and Starlink internet satellites. The crew will likely return in the early hours of Sunday and splash down off the coast of Florida, though SpaceX has not yet released a firm schedule for the arrival back on Earth.\n\ntitle4:\nChina tech companies AI models vs OpenAI, Google, Meta\ndescription4:\nChina is looking to challenge the U.S. in artificial intelligence. China's tech giants have launched their own AI models. Niphon | Istock | Getty Images\nGlobal attention around generative artificial intelligence has been focused on big U.S. companies like OpenAI, Alphabet 's Google and Meta . But some of China's giants, from Alibaba to Tencent, have launched their own AI models over the past 18 months, looking to capitalize on the hype around the technology. China's ambitions to become a world leader in AI adds another layer to the country's technology battle with the U.S. China has been seen as playing catchup to the U.S. but the race is heating up. Generative AI includes applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has the ability to generate text, images and even video based on user prompts. These applications are powered by large AI models which are trained on huge amounts of data, such as Google's Gemini.\nChinese technology firms have had to tread carefully in releasing their technology as Beijing has strict requirements for AI models and their uses. CNBC runs through the big Chinese AI models developed by the country's biggest tech firms.\nBaidu: ERNIE\nBaidu , one of China's biggest internet companies, was among the first in the country to launch generative AI applications. Its model powers Ernie Bot, an AI chatbot designed to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and which the Chinese company says has 300 million users. Before the \"Turbo\" version of the model, Baidu said that its latest version \u2014 Ernie 4.0 \u2014 has capabilities on par with OpenAI's GPT-4. The foundational model can understand and reason, according to Baidu. Like other companies, Baidu is selling the ability to use its AI model via its cloud computing division.\nAlibaba: Tongyi Qianwen\nAlibaba launched its set of foundational models, Tongyi Qianwen, last year. Often shortened to Qwen, Alibaba has developed various versions that can carry out different tasks. For example, one model is focused on creating content or solving math problems. Another can understand audio-based inputs and give text-based outputs. Some versions of its Qwen models are open-sourced, meaning they can be openly downloaded, with some limitations, and used by developers. Alibaba said in May its Qwen models have been deployed by over 90,000 enterprise users.\nTencent: Hunyuan\nLast year, Tencent launched its own foundational model called Hunyuan. Companies can access Hunyuan's capabilities via Tencent's cloud computing business. Tencent has said Hunyuan has strong Chinese language processing abilities and \"advanced\" logical reasoning. The model can support functions including image creation and text recognition. Tencent has positioned the model as one that can be used by companies in industries from gaming to social media and e-commerce. Tencent runs China's biggest messaging app, WeChat. The company this year launched an AI chatbot based on its Hunyuan model. The AI assistant, known as Yuanbao, can pull information and content from WeChat, as Tencent looks to differentiate its offering from rivals.\nHuawei: Pangu\nHuawei has taken a slightly different approach to rivals with its Pangu AI models. It has created a number of AI models aimed at customers in specific industries including government, finance, manufacturing, mining, and meteorology. For example, Huawei said its Pangu Meteorology Model can predict the trajectory of a typhoon over 10 days in around 10 seconds, rather than the four-to-five hours it took previously. These models, sold through the firm's cloud computing business, can also support generative features such as the ability to generate code and virtual human avatars.\nByteDance: Doubao\"\n\nResponse:",
