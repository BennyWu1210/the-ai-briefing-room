Intel Foundry\u2019s leadership isn\u2019t changing, and the subsidiary will remain inside Intel. But Intel Foundry will gain an operating board including independent directors.\nGelsinger also said the company would pause its chip fabrication projects in Poland and Germany for two years \u201cbased on anticipated market demand,\u201d and consider pulling back on its chip packaging and testing operations in Malaysia. Intel previously pledged to spend over $36 billion to build semiconductor factories in Magdeburg, Germany, $4.6 billion on a chip plant near the Polish city of Wroclaw, and $7 billion on its Malaysia footprint.\nBut in a win for the foundry business, Gelsinger revealed that Intel has signed a deal with AWS to co-develop an AI chip using Intel\u2019s 18A chip fabrication process. Intel has also agreed to produce a custom Xeon 6 processor for AWS, building on an existing partnership between the two firms.\n\u201cWe have tripled our deal pipeline since the beginning of the year,\u201d Gelsinger said of Intel Foundry\u2019s business, describing the AWS deal as a \u201cmulti-year, multi-billion-dollar framework\u201d that could potentially involve additional chip designs. He added that it \u201cdemonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business.\u201d\nIntel\u2019s cost-cutting and dealmaking \u2014 along with a newly-awarded $3.5 billion contract to build chips for the Pentagon \u2014 sent the company\u2019s stock soaring over 6% at market close. It\u2019s a bright spot in Intel\u2019s otherwise grim fiscal year.\nIn Q1, Intel posted a $437 million net loss \u2014 a loss that widened to $1.6 billion in Q2. Intel Foundry posted $5.3 billion in operating losses in H1, despite a slight year-over-year climb in revenue.\nIntel also reportedly lost out on a major customer, Sony, after failing to come to a chip manufacturing agreement for Sony\u2019s next Playstation console. That tie-up would\u2019ve contributed $30 billion to Intel\u2019s foundry business, according to Reuters.\nThis summer, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-reduction plan, which included laying off 15,000 staffers through separation and early retirement offerings. (Intel says it\u2019s more than halfway through the process and expects to wrap up by the end of the year.) The chipmaker has also reportedly considered selling its autonomous driving arm Mobileye and its enterprise networking division.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI announces new independent board oversight committee for safety\ndescription1:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on May 21, 2024.\nOpenAI on Monday said its Safety and Security Committee, which the company introduced in May as it dealt with controversy over security processes, will become an independent board oversight committee.\nThe group will be chaired by Zico Kolter, director of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University's school of computer science. Other members include Adam D'Angelo, an OpenAI board member and co-founder of Quora, former NSA chief and board member Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, former executive vice president at Sony.\nThe committee will oversee \"the safety and security processes guiding OpenAI's model deployment and development,\" the company said. It recently wrapped up its 90-day review evaluating OpenAI's processes and safeguards and then made recommendations to the board. OpenAI is releasing the group's findings as a public blog post.\nOpenAI, the Microsoft -backed startup behind ChatGPT and SearchGPT, is currently pursuing a funding round that would value the company at more than $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because details of the round haven't been made public. Thrive Capital is leading the round and plans to invest $1 billion, and Tiger Global is planning to join as well. Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple are reportedly also in talks to invest.\nThe committee's five key recommendations included the need to establish independent governance for safety and security, enhance security measures, be transparent about OpenAI's work, collaborate with external organizations; and unify the company's safety frameworks.\nLast week, OpenAI released o1, a preview version of its new AI model focused on reasoning and \"solving hard problems.\" The company said the committee \"reviewed the safety and security criteria that OpenAI used to assess OpenAI o1's fitness for launch,\" as well as safety evaluation results.\nThe committee will \"along with the full board, exercise oversight over model launches, including having the authority to delay a release until safety concerns are addressed.\"\nWhile OpenAI has been in hyper-growth mode since late 2022, when it launched ChatGPT, it's been simultaneously riddled with controversy and high-level employee departures, with some current and former employees concerned that the company is growing too quickly to operate safely.\nIn July, Democratic senators sent a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman concerning \"questions about how OpenAI is addressing emerging safety concerns.\" The prior month, a group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter describing concerns about a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.\nAnd in May, a former OpenAI board member, speaking about Altman's temporary ouster in November, said he gave the board \"inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place\" on multiple occasions.\nThat month, OpenAI decided to disband its team focused on the long-term risks of AI just a year after announcing the group. The team's leaders, Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, announced their departures from OpenAI in May. Leike wrote in a post on X that OpenAI's \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\nWATCH: OpenAI is indisputable leader in AI supercycle\n\ntitle2:\nSlack is turning into an AI agent hub. Should it?\ndescription2:\nThe head of Slack, Denise Dresser, tells TechCrunch she is shifting the business chat platform into a \u201cwork operating system,\u201d specifically by making Slack a hub for AI applications from Salesforce, Adobe, and Anthropic. The company\u2019s CEO sees Slack as more than a place to chat with your coworkers, but do users want that? And if they do, will they pay a premium for it?\nSlack announced several new features on Monday for a pricier tier of the messaging platform: Slack AI. The updates include AI-generated Huddle summaries, similar to the channel summaries already available to those subscribers. Users can also now chat with Salesforce\u2019s AI agents in Slack, alongside tools from third parties that will enable AI web search and AI image generation.\nDemo of Agentforce in Slack (Salesforce)\nSalesforce purchased Slack in 2021, shortly after the messaging platform became a staple of remote work for millions of people. Three years later, Salesforce is pivoting hard to AI agents \u2014 apparently so hard that their popular messaging service is doing it too. Slack CEO Denise Dresser says the platform will play a key role in the transformation, since it\u2019s a natural place to interact with AI agents, because people are already chatting there throughout the workday.\n\u201cAI is showing us a new way to experience technology which is very organic to Slack: it\u2019s conversational, you\u2019re surfacing information, and you\u2019re taking action right in the flow of work,\u201d said Dresser, who took over as Slack\u2019s chief executive 10 months ago, in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a better place and product than Slack to allow you to do that.\u201d\nBut why does Slack need AI? Ever since ChatGPT launched in 2022, a lot of companies have introduced AI features as a way to appear \u201ccutting edge\u201d even if the integration doesn\u2019t make much sense to the core product. Slack adding AI agents to its messaging service doesn\u2019t seem to be an obvious exception.\nDresser\u2019s justification for AI agents is that Slack is not simply a work messaging platform, but rather a digital workplace or work OS that \u201cbrings all your people and processes together.\u201d\nThe head of Slack tells TechCrunch that every CEO is asking for AI features, such as ways to quickly catch up on team discussions or tools to surface information buried in some database. These are some small ways Slack is trying to bring companies into the AI era, she explained.\nOne of Slack\u2019s new agents, Agentforce, will allow Salesforce customers to perform on-demand analysis of business data directly in Slack. Cohere and Anthropic\u2019s Slack agents will offer similar services, as long as you\u2019re paying for their enterprise AI services.\nPerplexity is also releasing an agent for Slack that will let you search the web. Adobe Express\u2019s Slack agent will let you create branded content from text prompts within the messaging service.\nKlarna\u2019s CEO made headlines last month when he announced plans to drop Salesforce and Workday as software providers and replace them with internally built AI tools. Andreessen Horowitz partners published a blog post in July predicting changes like this, where businesses would shift away from the pricey CRM services in favor of in-house AI solutions. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff is skeptical of Klarna\u2019s AI solutions, and wants to see some proof the company is really doing it.\nWhen asked about the Klarna CEO\u2019s comments, Dresser said that enterprise AI solutions need to be trustworthy and safe, two things Salesforce is trying to guarantee for customers.\nThat trust was tested earlier this year when Slack came under fire for training a recommender system on customer data by default, according to part of its privacy policy found by developers on Hacker News. It was later revealed that Slack was using customer data to power emoji recommendations, and not its large language models underlying Slack AI. But still, the privacy policy claimed that Slack required users to send an email to the company if they didn\u2019t want their messages to be part of Slack\u2019s training data.\nSlack claimed to not use customer data to train Slack AI then, and continues to today.\n\u201cNo LLMs are trained on Slack data, period,\u201d said chief product officer Rob Seaman in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cHonestly, there was a hiccup and an update to a policy on our website that we could have handled better. Especially in this age of AI and heightened awareness of how your data is being used, that turned into a thing we wish hadn\u2019t.\u201d\nThese questions around privacy only become more prevalent as Slack leans further into AI. The service is changing from strictly messaging into one where AI tools are pulling information in and out of the platform. Users have good reason to be skeptical as AI becomes just another tool in the box.\n\ntitle3:\nApple Watch sleep apnea detection gets FDA approval\ndescription3:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration Monday published approval for sleep apnea detection on the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2. The green light comes four days ahead of the Series 10\u2019s September 20 release date.\nThe feature, announced at last week\u2019s iPhone 16 event, will arrive as part of the imminent watchOS 11 release. Once enabled, it requires 10 nights of sleep tracking data spread out over a 30-day span to determine whether a user may have the condition. During that time, it also offers insights into nightly sleeping disturbances, utilizing the on-board accelerometer.\nThe FDA classes the feature as an \u201cover-the-counter device to assess risk of sleep apnea.\u201d Apple is quick to note that the addition is not a diagnostic tool. Rather, it will prompt users to seek a formal diagnosis from a healthcare provider. The condition, which causes breathing to become shallower or repeatedly stop during the night, is associated with a variety of different symptoms. The Mayo Clinic notes that it can cause insomnia, headaches, daytime sleepiness, and other longer-term conditions.\nApple isn\u2019t the first consumer electronics firm to offer the feature. Withings has offered sleep apnea detection in devices for some time, while Samsung received FDA approval for its Galaxy Watch line earlier this.\nThe feature arrives as another \u2014 blood oxygen detection \u2014 has been disabled on Apple Watches in the U.S. over an ongoing patent dispute.\n\ntitle4:\niOS 18 is out: Here's what's new\ndescription4:\nApple\u2019s newest software update, iOS 18, is rolling out today to all iPhone users. While AI technology was heavily hyped as a key part of this upgrade, Apple Intelligence features aren\u2019t part of this release. Instead, Apple says it will release Apple Intelligence features with iOS 18.1 starting with the U.S. before gradually rolling them out to more global markets over the months ahead.\nWith iOS 18, the focus is on personalization, including custom icons, a revamped Control Center, and support for locked and hidden apps.\nUsers will be able to place icons anywhere on the grid or make them larger, which hides the text label, offering more control over the iOS Home Screen. The move will particularly appeal to Gen Z consumers, including those who rapidly adopted custom icons with the launch of iOS 14 years ago. While users will be able to switch to a dark mode or customize their icons with a tinted color of their choosing, third-party app developers will also be able to release custom icons to take full advantage of the functionality.\nSome developers may be ready on day one but others are still working on icon updates.\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe iOS Control Center, which offers easy access to common functions with a swipe down on the Home Screen, has also gone through a big overhaul with this release.\nBy default, there are now four pages of controls focused on favorites, music controls, home, and connectivity. The latter includes controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, your personal hot spot, and more. Everything is customizable in the new Control Center, too. You can add or remove pages or icons.\nMeanwhile, on the iPhone\u2019s Lock Screen, users will be able to swap out Lock Screen shortcuts for their preferred apps. For instance, you can replace the default camera button on the Lock Screen with a third-party camera app, such as Obscura or Halide.\nWhen it comes to privacy, iOS 18 brings a way to lock apps behind Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. You can hide these apps from the Home Screen, too. After that, they only appear in a new hidden app folder in the App Library.\nImage Credits: Apple\nWhat do you get out of the box?\nThe Photos app has been redesigned with iOS 18 as well, though not all have welcomed the changes in the beta releases of the software. The company did away with tabs at the bottom of the screen and adopted a single page design with an aim to bring more attention to surfacing different photos from your library.\nIn the Photos apps you will see albums, but also collection folders such as Recent Days, People & Pets, Pinned Collections, Memories, Trips (a new feature), Utilities, and Media type. You can customize the visibility and order of these items.\nThe idea is to turn the Photos app into more than just a utility, but the result is an app that\u2019s harder to navigate, some have complained. The design has been tweaked since its debut and could be updated again if user backlash increases.\nImage Credits: Apple\nAnother major change is Apple\u2019s newly added support for RCS (Rich Communication Services), a hypercharged version of SMS, which will allow Android users to send and receive high-quality media with those on iPhone. Both iPhone and Android users will get typing indicators and read receipts for conversations between the two platforms as well. While messages from Android users will still show up as green bubbles, this feature might help restore parity between the two platforms.\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe Apple Phone app was updated in iOS 18 with features that make it easier to search through your phone call logs and use the number pad to find a contact. While this is seemingly a small update, finding when you last called someone via a quick search can be handy. In addition, iOS 18 lets you switch between SIM cards while calling. Plus, there is now support for live voicemail transcription in a dozen more languages and regions.\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe OS ships with a new Passwords app, too. These sensitive credentials were previously stored in a submenu in the Settings app. Now they get their own app, which makes them more accessible to end users, but also puts Apple in more direct competition with password app developers like 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane, and others. However, unlike many of those third-party apps, it doesn\u2019t store sensitive items that aren\u2019t passwords \u2014 like credit cards, IDs, or secure notes. But if you\u2019re not already using a password app, having a built-in option could help users who don\u2019t typically think about their password security.\nOther notable updates include the following:\nFinally, the ability to schedule messages.\nA new update supports multilingual and multiscript keyboards. (It has also added improved language search for certain Indian languages.)\nThe Translation app added support for Hindi.\nThe Notes app lets you make collapsible sections and supports audio transcriptions.\nThe Calculator app can handle advanced math equations.\nAI is coming\nIn June at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and earlier this month and during the iPhone 16 launch event, Apple spent a good chunk of time discussing Apple Intelligence. It is ironic that the iPhone 16 \u2014 the phone the company describes as \u201cbuilt from the ground up for Apple Intelligence\u201d \u2014 will ship without Apple Intelligence. (That explains why Apple was developing technology to update the iPhone\u2019s operating system while still in its retail box in stores.)\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe tech giant said it will ship AI features starting in October with support for U.S. English. Later this year, Apple will add support for localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. Next year, it will add support for additional languages, including Chinese, French, Japanese, Spanish, and Indian English.\nWith developer betas, Apple tested AI-powered writing tools; the ability to summarize notifications; email summaries; and a new focus mode called \u201cReduce Interruptions.\u201d The company also tested a feature to clean up photos by removing unwanted people and objects.\nImage Credits: Apple\nIt\u2019s not clear when each of these features will make it to the public release. However, only customers with an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, an iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, or an iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max will be able to experience the AI technology. There may be some exclusive features for the iPhone 16, such as visual search, activated by the 16\u2019s new Camera Control button.\nAs noted in our iOS 18 preview for the public beta release in July, iOS 18\u2019s initial release only tells one part of the story. The launch of Apple Intelligence feels like the finale. At this point, we can\u2019t say if the second part is engaging enough just yet as we can only judge Apple Intelligence from the trailer and beta trials.\"\n\nResponse:",
