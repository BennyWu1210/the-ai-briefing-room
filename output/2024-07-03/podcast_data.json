Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday July 4), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon is bricking its Astro business robots less than a year after launch\ndescription0:\nSubject: An important message about Astro for Business\nDear Astro for Business customer,\nAt Amazon, we seek to invent new solutions like Astro for Business to help serve our customers. While we are proud of what we\u2019ve built, we\u2019ve made the decision to end support for Astro for Business to put our focus on making Astro the best robot for the home.\nIn the coming weeks, Amazon will fully refund all Astro for Business device purchases to the original payment method. If your original payment method is no longer on file or is expired, we will issue a credit to your Amazon account equal to the amount you paid. You do not need to take any additional steps to receive your refund.\nWe are also adding a $300 credit to your Amazon account to help support a replacement solution for your workplace, as well as issuing you an automatic invite to the Astro Day 1 Editions Program if you\u2019d like to continue your journey with Astro in your home.\nWhat this means for you:\nOn 9/25, your Astro for Business device will no longer function and your personal data will be deleted from the device. Any patrol or investigation videos recorded by Astro will still be available in your Ring app until your video storage time expires or your Ring Protect subscription ends.\nWe encourage you to recycle your Astro for Business device and accessories through the Amazon Recycling Program\u2014Amazon covers the costs associated with shipping and recycling your devices and accessories. Find more information about the Amazon Recycling Program and get your free shipping label by clicking the link: https://amazonrecycling-us.re-teck.com/recycling/home.\nIf you\u2019re an Astro Secure subscriber:\nOn 9/25, we will discontinue Astro Secure, and your subscription benefits will automatically end. You will no longer be charged any subscription fees for Astro Secure beginning 7/3 and will receive a refund in the coming days for any unused, pre-paid subscription fees to the payment method associated with your Ring account.\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to customer service for additional information. Thank you for being an Amazon customer.\nSincerely,\nThe Astro for Business team\n\ntitle1:\nTwilio alerts Authy two-factor app users that \u2018threat actors\u2019 have their phone numbers\ndescription1:\nTwilio says someone has obtained phone numbers associated with its two-factor authentication service (2FA), Authy, as reported earlier by TechCrunch. In a security alert on Monday, Twilio warns that the \u201cthreat actors\u201d may try to use the stolen phone numbers to carry out phishing attacks and other scams.\nThe incident follows a 2022 data breach that occurred after a phishing campaign tricked employees into disclosing their login credentials. The attackers accessed data from 163 Twilio accounts and managed to access and register additional devices on 93 Authy accounts.\nTwilio traced this leak back to \u201can unauthenticated endpoint\u201d that it has since secured. Last week, the threat actor ShinyHunters published a list of 33 million phone numbers from Authy accounts on the dark web. As pointed out by BleepingComputer, the threat actor seems to have obtained the information by inputting a massive list of phone numbers into Authy\u2019s unsecured API endpoint, which would then verify whether they\u2019re associated with the app.\n\ntitle2:\nLG buys Homey in a very Samsung SmartThings move\ndescription2:\nLG has acquired an 80 percent stake in Athom, a Dutch company best known for its Homey smart home platform. The deal, which LG says will see it acquire the remaining 20 percent of Athom within the next three years, has been forged to expand LG\u2019s smart home ecosystem and should position it to better compete against Samsung\u2019s rivaling SmartThings platform.\nLG plans to integrate Athom\u2019s existing Homey connectivity \u2014 which supports smart devices from Sonos, Ikea, Aqara, Philips Hue, and more \u2014 across its appliances through its ThinQ smart home platform. According to Homey, its users will soon be able to control ThinQ-enabled LG appliances via the platform. Homey has developed a significant user base since it was founded in 2014, with its flagship Homey Pro smart home hub capable of connecting to over 50,000 devices across Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, Matter, and Thread.\nThe deal will enable LG to incorporate third-party devices and services into its ThinQ ecosystem for the first time. LG executive vice president Jung Ki-hyun refers to the Athom acquisition as \u201ca cornerstone for our AI home business.\u201d LG announced plans during CES in January to bring so-called \u201cAffectionate Intelligence\u201d to its ThinQ smart home platform \u2014 which Homey\u2019s connection to appliances, sensors, and lighting may now play a part in.\nLG says that Athom will continue to operate as an independent company following the acquisition, retaining its current branding and operations. It\u2019s a similar move to Samsung acquiring SmartThings for $200 million in 2014, which has since seen Samsung building multi-connectivity SmartThings support into soundbars, TVs, smart fridges, monitors, and more.\n\u201cHomey will continue as it is, with Athom remaining committed to developing Homey Cloud and Homey Pro\u201d\n\u201cHomey will continue as it is, with Athom remaining committed to developing Homey Cloud and Homey Pro, and keep working on an ever-expanding lineup of new products,\u201d said Homey in its acquisition statement. \u201cBoth the founders, Emile Nijssen & Stefan Witkamp, will stay on as executives of Athom, and continue to execute their vision and create a better smart home for everyone.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nCloudflare launches a tool to combat AI bots\ndescription3:\nCloudflare, the publicly traded cloud service provider, has launched a new, free tool to prevent bots from scraping websites hosted on its platform for data to train AI models.\nSome AI vendors, including Google, OpenAI and Apple, allow website owners to block the bots they use for data scraping and model training by amending their site\u2019s robots.txt, the text file that tells bots which pages they can access on a website. But, as Cloudflare points out in a post announcing its bot-combating tool, not all AI scrapers respect this.\n\u201cCustomers don\u2019t want AI bots visiting their websites, and especially those that do so dishonestly,\u201d the company writes on its official blog. \u201cWe fear that some AI companies intent on circumventing rules to access content will persistently adapt to evade bot detection.\u201d\nSo, in an attempt to address the problem, Cloudflare analyzed AI bot and crawler traffic to fine-tune automatic bot detection models. The models consider, among other factors, whether an AI bot might be trying to evade detection by mimicking the appearance and behavior of someone using a web browser.\n\u201cWhen bad actors attempt to crawl websites at scale, they generally use tools and frameworks that we are able to fingerprint,\u201d Cloudflare writes. \u201cBased on these signals, our models [are] able to appropriately flag traffic from evasive AI bots as bots.\u201d\nCloudflare has set up a form for hosts to report suspected AI bots and crawlers and says that it\u2019ll continue to manually blacklist AI bots over time.\nThe problem of AI bots has come into sharp relief as the generative AI boom fuels the demand for model training data.\nMany sites, wary of AI vendors training models on their content without alerting or compensating them, have opted to block AI scrapers and crawlers. Around 26% of the top 1,000 sites on the web have blocked OpenAI\u2019s bot, according to one study; another found that more than 600 news publishers had blocked the bot.\nBlocking isn\u2019t a surefire protection, however. As alluded to earlier, some vendors appear to be ignoring standard bot exclusion rules to gain a competitive advantage in the AI race. AI search engine Perplexity was recently accused of impersonating legitimate visitors to scrape content from websites, and OpenAI and Anthropic are said to have at times ignored robots.txt rules.\nIn a letter to publishers last month, content licensing startup TollBit said that, in fact, it sees \u201cmany AI agents\u201d ignoring the robots.txt standard.\nTools like Cloudflare\u2019s could help \u2014 but only if they prove to be accurate in detecting clandestine AI bots. And they won\u2019t solve the more intractable problem of publishers risking sacrificing referral traffic from AI tools like Google\u2019s AI Overviews, which exclude sites from inclusion if they block specific AI crawlers.\n\ntitle4:\nThreads hits 175 million users after a year\ndescription4:\nA year and a half ago, Threads was but a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s eye.\nNow, the rival to Elon Musk\u2019s X has reached more than 175 million monthly active users, the Meta CEO announced on Wednesday.\nAs with any social network, and especially for Threads, monthly users only tell part of the growth story. It\u2019s telling that, unlike Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, Meta hasn\u2019t shared daily user numbers yet. That omission suggests Threads is still getting a lot of flyby traffic from people who have yet to become regular users.\nI\u2019ve heard from Meta employees in recent months that much of the app\u2019s growth is still coming from it being promoted inside Instagram. Both apps share the same account system, which isn\u2019t expected to change.\nEven still, 175 million monthly users for a one-year app is nothing to turn your nose up at, especially given Meta\u2019s spotty track record of launching standalone app experiments over the years. Zuckerberg has been open to me and others that he thinks Threads has a real shot at being the company\u2019s next billion-user app. To keep the growth story going, I\u2019m told, Meta is focused on markets where it thinks there\u2019s an opening to take more market share from X \u2014 Japan, for example.\nFor now, Threads is still a loss leader for Meta financially, though it can certainly afford to fund it indefinitely. Internally, I\u2019m told execs are thinking about turning on ads in Threads sometime next year, though the exact plan is still up in the air. It\u2019s easy to see how Threads could plug into Instagram\u2019s existing ads system. And given Meta\u2019s intentional decision to deprioritize politics and encourage lighthearted content, it could be a compelling place for advertisers looking for a more brand-safe alternative to X.\"\n\nResponse:",
