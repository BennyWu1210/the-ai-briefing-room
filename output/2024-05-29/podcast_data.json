Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

PwC did not specify the number of workers who would use ChatGPT Enterprise.\n\"By embracing ChatGPT Enterprise across our workforce, we will bring our first-hand experience of our AI transformation to clients, complementing our audit, tax and consulting services with a broad array of business and industry solutions,\" the company said.\nPwC didn't disclose the financial terms of the deal.\n\ntitle1:\nFormer OpenAI board member explains why CEO Sam Altman was fired\ndescription1:\nHelen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, speaks onstage during Vox Media's 2023 Code Conference in Dana Point, California, Sept. 27, 2023.\nFormer OpenAI board member Helen Toner, who helped oust CEO Sam Altman in November, broke her silence when she spoke on a podcast released Tuesday about events inside the company leading up to Altman's firing.\nOne example she gave: When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the board was not informed in advance and found out about it on Twitter. Toner also said Altman did not tell the board he owned the OpenAI startup fund.\nAltman was renamed CEO less than a week after he was fired, but Toner's comments give insight into the decision for the first time.\n\"The board is a nonprofit board that was set up explicitly for the purpose of making sure that the company's public good mission was primary, was coming first \u2014 over profits, investor interests, and other things,\" Toner said on \"The TED AI Show\" podcast.\n\"But for years, Sam had made it really difficult for the board to actually do that job by withholding information, misrepresenting things that were happening at the company, in some cases outright lying to the board,\" she said.\nToner said Altman gave the board \"inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place\" on multiple occasions.\n\"For any individual case, Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous-sounding explanation of why it wasn't a big deal, or misinterpreted, or whatever,\" Toner said. \"But the end effect was that after years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him came to the conclusion that we just couldn't believe things that Sam was telling us, and that's just a completely unworkable place to be in as a board \u2014 especially a board that is supposed to be providing independent oversight over the company, not just helping the CEO to raise more money.\"\nToner explained that the board had worked to improve issues. She said that, in October, a month before the ousting, the board had conversations with two executives who relayed experiences with Altman they weren't comfortable sharing before, including screenshots and documentation of problematic interactions and mistruths.\n\"The two of them suddenly started telling us ... how they couldn't trust him, about the toxic atmosphere he was creating,\" Toner said. \"They used the phrase 'psychological abuse,' telling us they didn't think he was the right person to lead the company to AGI, telling us they had no belief that he could or would change.\"\nArtificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a broad term that refers to a type of artificial intelligence that outperforms human abilities on various cognitive tasks.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.\nEarlier this month, OpenAI disbanded its team focused on the long-term risks of AI a year after the company announced the group. The news came days after both team leaders, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, announced their departures from the Microsoft-backed startup. Leike, who has since announced he is joining AI competitor Anthropic, wrote on Friday that OpenAI's \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\nToner's comments and the high-profile departures follow last year's leadership crisis.\nIn November, OpenAI's board ousted Altman, saying it had conducted \"a deliberative review process\" and that Altman \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\"\n\"The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\" it said.\nThe Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that while Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that artificial intelligence would not harm humans, others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.\nAltman's removal prompted resignations and threats of resignations, including an open letter signed by virtually all of OpenAI's employees, and uproar from investors, including Microsoft. Within a week, Altman was back and board members Toner and Tasha McCauley, who had voted to oust Altman, were out. Sutskever relinquished his seat on the board and remained on staff until he announced his departure on May 14. Adam D'Angelo, who had also voted to oust Altman, remains on the board.\nIn March, OpenAI announced its new board, which includes Altman, and the conclusion of an internal investigation by law firm WilmerHale into the events leading up to Altman's ouster.\nOpenAI did not publish the WilmerHale investigation report but summarized its findings.\n\"The review concluded there was a significant breakdown of trust between the prior board and Sam and Greg,\" OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said at the time, referring to president and co-founder Greg Brockman. The review also \"concluded the board acted in good faith ... [and] did not anticipate some of the instability that led afterwards,\" Taylor added.\n\ntitle2:\nApple to open first store in Malaysia as Asia expansion continues\ndescription2:\nThe new iPhone 15 Pro is displayed during an Apple event at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 12, 2023.\nApple plans to open its first store in Malaysia next month, the company said Wednesday, underscoring a bigger push into the Asia region beyond China.\nThe store will be located at The Exchange TRX mall in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.\nIt will open on June 22 at 10 a.m. local time, Apple said.\n\ntitle3:\nCadillac Optiq, the brand\u2019s most affordable EV, will start at $54,000\ndescription3:\nIf you\u2019re looking for an electric car and Cadillac sounds like your kind of brand, but the $64,000 Lyriq is too rich for your blood (to say nothing about the $340,000 bespoke Celestiq), you may find what you\u2019re looking for in the 2025 Optiq.\nSince first revealing the Optiq last November, Cadillac has been pitching this two-row SUV as its entry-level model \u2014 and now we know exactly what that means. The 2025 Optiq starts at $54,000, which is affordable for a luxury brand like Cadillac. And it will come with all sorts of standard goodies to help boost its sales pitch, including dual-motor all-wheel drive, Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance, and a ton of native Google apps.\nWhat it won\u2019t have is the ability to mirror your smartphone on the central display, so no Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. But you knew that already.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how customers, especially younger ones that Cadillac is desperate to win over, react to the absence of the popular phone projection systems. For what it\u2019s worth, Cadillac, which has said it will have a \u201cfully electric portfolio\u201d by the end of the decade, is bullish on its appeal to younger customers.\nIn a press release, Global Cadillac VP John Roth said the brand\u2019s percentage of younger buyers \u201chas increased 5 percent in the U.S.\u201d In other words, Cadillac isn\u2019t your grandfather\u2019s car company anymore.\nThe 2025 Optiq sports an 85kWh battery pack that can add about 79 miles of range in 10 minutes when plugged in to a DC fast charger. The total range estimate is 300 miles, but that\u2019s General Motors\u2019 estimate, not the Environmental Protection Agency, which tends to have the final word.\nCadillac says the Optiq is designed to be a sportier drive than most compact SUVs, with low-rolling tires, diffusers, and a rear spoiler. The dual-motor setup also helps, putting out 300 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. That\u2019s a little less horsepower and a little more torque than the Lyriq, which should be interesting to experience when behind the wheel.\nThe Optiq\u2019s wheelbase of 116 inches makes it slightly longer than Cadillac\u2019s gas-powered XT5 but a half-foot shorter than the Lyriq. With its second row up, the Optiq has 26 cubic feet of cargo space and 57 cubic feet with the second row folded flat. With its 10-module Ultium battery in the floor of the vehicle, the compact SUV will have a base curb weight of 5,192 lbs.\nIn a briefing with reporters last month, John Cockburn, chief engineer of the Optiq, said the EV would feel quicker and more nimble than the Lyriq. \u201cIt is not a Lyriq,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vehicle feels considerably different.\u201d\nIn addition to typical EV features like one-pedal driving, the Optiq will also have a regen system that allows drivers to slow down or stop the vehicle using shifter paddles behind the steering wheel. There will be four drive modes, including Tour, Sport, Snow/Ice, and a personalized My Mode.\nThe Optiq sits on 20-inch wheels, with an option to switch up to 21 inches. The \u201cblack crystal\u201d grille is laser-etched and offsets Cadillac\u2019s unique vertical headlights. And a rear-quarter panel features a Mondrian pattern in the acoustic laminate glass that\u2019s also found throughout the vehicle \u2014 and most notably in the Cadillac logo.\nInside, you\u2019ll find leather trim, a spacious moonroof, and a 33-inch curved display that combines the instrument cluster with the central touchscreen in one solid piece of glass. The Optiq features Google\u2019s built-in Android software, including Google Maps, the Google Play Store, and a Google-powered voice assistant.\nLots of Google apps, but no Android Auto. GM is betting that customers won\u2019t revolt over the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \u2014 even though many have said it could be a dealbreaker. When asked about this during the briefing, Roth said that a \u201ctightly integrated\u201d software experience will help win customers over. \u201cImaging and mirroring just can\u2019t give you the experience that we believe we can give you with a fully integrated system,\u201d he said.\nWhat the Optiq may be lacking in UI options, it could make up for in price. The list price of $54,000 isn\u2019t that attractive on its face, but it could come down a lot when applying the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. GM spokesperson Stephanie Obendorfer said the company expects the Optiq to qualify for the credit at launch.\n\ntitle4:\nChina will focus on AI in its new chip fund amid U.S. export curbs: professor\ndescription4:\nDigitally Generated Images Wong Yu Liang | Moment | Getty Images\nChina set up a multibillion-dollar state-backed investment chip fund last week \u2014 and one observer says it will likely focus on advanced chips for AI and establishing the entire supply chain. \"Fund 3 will focus on [establishing] the total supply chain. Now, for Fund 1 and 2, they put a lot of focus on the equipment and materials related areas,\" Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law said Wednesday. \"And now, because [Fund 3] is established in the middle of the AI boom, I believe they will put more effort, emphasis on advanced computing chips and memory chips for future AI,\" Ma told told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"\nwatch now\nChina has piled 344 billion Chinese yuan ($47.5 billion) into a third investment fund that aims to boost its domestic semiconductor industry amid an escalating technology war with the U.S. The China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, also known as the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund and the Big Fund, is part of China's efforts to reduce foreign reliance in its domestic chip industry. It comes as countries in the West, such as the U.S. and the Netherlands, limit its access to advanced technology. The new fund will be the largest of three funds so far. The first two funds raised 138.7 billion yuan and 204 billion yuan in 2014 and 2019 respectively.\nwatch now\"\n\nResponse:",
