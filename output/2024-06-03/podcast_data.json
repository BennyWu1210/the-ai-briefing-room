Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

At WWDC, the Cupertino tech giant will showcase how it\u2019s chosen to integrate AI technology into its devices and software, including through a historic partnership with OpenAI. As the big event nears, all sorts of leaks have emerged about what iOS 18 and its rumored AI-powered apps and features have in store.\nAmong the changes, Apple is said to be powering some of its new AI features with its Ajax LLM. Other reports indicate that Apple plans to process data from AI in a way that even employees won\u2019t be able to access, which would help Apple continue to deliver on its promise of data privacy for its users.\nBelow, we\u2019ll take a look at how Apple is said to be adding AI to its apps and services in the next big update for the iPhone, alongside other improvements and changes coming to iOS 18.\nSiri\u2019s AI-enabled future\nApple\u2019s digital assistant is prepared to get an AI revamp. The digital assistant will leverage Apple\u2019s own large language models and will allow Siri to control individual features inside applications. This will work without any necessary setup by developers or users, like App Intents or Siri Shortcuts currently require. Instead, users will be able to ask Siri to do things like delete an email or edit a photo, for example.\nSome of Siri\u2019s upgraded AI capabilities won\u2019t be ready until next year, however. For example, the ability for Siri to handle tasks with multiple steps, is likely delayed.\nA more advanced Siri will also come to Apple Watch for on-the-go use. You could use Siri on your Watch to play music on another device, one report said.\nSiri will receive more natural-sounding voices.\nSiri will be able to summarize notifications that include people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates and more.\nCould Siri\u2019s new look be hinted at in the animations below?\nGet ready for an action packed #WWDC24 next week! pic.twitter.com/8ttYkFJdQI \u2014 Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) June 3, 2024\nApple Photos\u2019 new look\nA new interface is being teased.\nPeople will also have the ability to retouch photos with AI, perhaps challenging Google Photos in this area.\nA \u201cClean Up\u201d feature, for instance, would let you remove objects from your photos using generative AI technology, similar to Google\u2019s Magic Eraser.\nOne report noted that Apple made an internal-only application called Generative Playground that uses genAI to create and edit images. It\u2019s unclear how this functionality will be presented to end users, though iMessage integration was spotted in the form of an app extension.\nSafari with more AI\nAI recaps of Safari web pages and news articles will be available through a new Intelligent Search feature. (Watch out Arc?)\nNotes injected with AI\nUsers will be able to ask for AI recaps of Notes.\nGenAI will also help to transcribe audio in Notes.\nIn-app audio recording will be supported alongside audio transcription and AI summarization.\nMath Notes will help users create graphs and solve equations through AI by recognizing the text of mathematical equations and then helping you to solve them.\nNotes users may also have the option to auto-complete their mathematical equations when typing.\nProject Greymatter is the code name for a set of AI tools that are being integrated into core like Safari, Photos and Notes, Bloomberg reported.\nVoice Memos transcriptions\nReal-time transcription for voice memos is also coming.\niMessages\u2019 gets an AI makeover\nGenerative AI emojis will be supported, letting users create their own emojis with technology.\nAI recaps of missed texts will also be available.\nOverall deeper Siri integration is expected.\nTapbacks will get new icons.\nMessage effects for individual words will be supported in addition to effects for the message itself.\nMessages will offer suggested replies generated by Apple\u2019s on-device Ajax LLM to make texting back easier.\nRCS support is also supported to arrive this year to bring read recipes, typing indicators and high-quality video and images when texting with Android users via iMessage.\nCalendar refresh\nApple\u2019s LLM will be able to communicate with the Calendar app to check for events when composing responses to messages.\nMail with support for AI\nMail will also get suggested email replies generated by Ajax.\nNew Settings interface\nSettings will hopefully get less confusing with a revamped interface and updates that include better organization and improved search.\nA new Music widget will be available \u2014 possibly to feature larger artwork?\nImprovements to HomeKit for smart home integrations.\nNotifications\nAI recaps of missed notifications will be available.\nApple is working on something called \u201cEnhanced\u201d notifications.\nSpotlight\nSpotlight is expected to get faster, more reliable search.\niOS 18 will bring the ability to place app icons wherever you want, instead of having to align them to the grid without spaces in between them.\nUsers will also be able to change the color of app icons, perhaps as Apple\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s Material You.\nMaps with route creation\nMaps will support custom route creation in iOS 18 which lets users design their own routes for a trip.\nMusic with AI-powered playlists\nApple Music may take on Spotify with its own AI-powered auto-generated playlists.\nMore improvements\nOther apps with updates planned include Freeform, Xcode and Apple\u2019s productivity apps, like Keynote and Pages, which may get genAI features.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft layoffs hit HoloLens, Azure cloud teams\ndescription1:\nOn Monday, Microsoft announced layoffs reportedly affecting around 1,000 employees. As reported previously by CNBC, the mixed reality department working on HoloLens 2 is one of the areas affected. Separately, Business Insider reported that Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering has also seen cuts of \u201chundreds\u201d of employees.\nMicrosoft spokesperson Craig Cincotta said in a statement emailed to The Verge, \u201cEarlier today, we announced a restructuring of Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality organization. We remain fully committed to the Department of Defense\u2019s IVAS program and will continue to deliver cutting-edge technology to support our soldiers. In addition, we will continue to invest in W365 to reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem. We will continue to sell HoloLens 2 while supporting existing HoloLens 2 customers and partners.\u201d\n\u201cOrganizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business. We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners,\u201d said Cincotta.\n\ntitle2:\nAMD unveils new AI chips amid rising competition with Nvidia, Intel\ndescription2:\nLisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), during the AMD Advancing AI event in San Jose, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. unveiled new so-called accelerator chips that it said will be able to run artificial intelligence software faster than rival products. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nAMD on Monday announced new artificial intelligence chips as it seeks to establish itself as a leader amid competition with the likes of Nvidia and Intel .\n\"AI is our number one priority and we're at the beginning of an incredibly exciting time for the industry as AI transforms virtually every business, improves our quality of life, and reshapes every part of the computing market,\" chair and CEO Lisa Su said during the Computex tech conference in Taipei.\nDuring a keynote address, Su unveiled the Ryzen AI 300 series for next-generation AI laptops. The line could compete directly with Intel's upcoming Lunar Lake and Qualcomm 's Snapdragon X. And in partnership with Microsoft , these chips will power laptops equipped with the tech giant's AI chatbot Copilot.\nSu also revealed the new Ryzen 9000 series for desktops, calling them \"the world's fastest consumer PC processors\" for gaming and content creation.\nBoth lines are expected to launch in July. This comes less than two months after AMD's April announcement of new processors that can run AI workloads \u2013 the Ryzen Pro 8040 for laptops and the Ryzen Pro 8000 for desktops.\n\ntitle3:\nSpotify price increased again\ndescription3:\nDaniel Ek, founder and chief executive officer of Spotify, attends the Cannes Lions 2016 on June 22, 2016 in Cannes, France.\nSpotify announced on Monday it is increasing the cost of its premium subscription plans in the U.S., marking the Swedish music-streaming company's second price hike in a year.\nU.S. Spotify users will be notified about the new change to their subscription over the next month.\nShares of Spotify were up more than 4% Monday morning.\nFor users in the U.S., an \"Individual\" plan will cost $11.99. A \"Duo\" plan will cost $16.99, and a \"Family\" plan will cost $19.99. The \"Student\" plan will still cost $5.99.\nSpotify said it is raising prices so the company can \"continue to invest in and innovate on our product features,\" according to a blog post.\nIn July 2023, Spotify increased the price of its Individual offering to $10.99. It also increased the prices of its Duo plan, Family plan and Student offering to $14.99, $16.99 and $5.99, respectively. The company said the market landscape has \"continued to evolve\" since Spotify launched, according to a release at the time.\nSpotify competitor Apple Music increased the cost of its subscription in late 2022. An individual subscription starts at $10.99 a month, according to Apple's website.\n\ntitle4:\nAfter raising $100M, AI fintech LoanSnap is being sued, fined, evicted\ndescription4:\nAI mortgage startup LoanSnap is facing an avalanche of lawsuits from creditors and has been evicted from its headquarters in Southern California, leaving employees worried about the company\u2019s future, TechCrunch has learned.\nLoanSnap, founded by serial entrepreneurs Karl Jacob (pictured above) and Allan Carroll, has raised around $100 million in funding since its 2017 seed round, $90 million of which was raised between 2021 and 2023, according to PitchBook. Investors include Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group, the Chainsmokers\u2019 Mantis Ventures, Baseline Ventures, and Reid Hoffman, LoanSnap says. The startup also took on around $12 million in debt, PitchBook estimates.\nDespite the capital it raised, since December 2022, LoanSnap has been sued by at least seven creditors, including Wells Fargo, who collectively alleged the startup owes them more than $2 million. LoanSnap has also been fined by state and federal agencies and nearly lost its license to operate in Connecticut, according to legal documents obtained by TechCrunch.\nWhile LoanSnap has not yet shut down, according to two employees, the vibe inside the company is harrowing as workers wait for clarity on the company\u2019s future. Between December 2023 and at least January 2024, the company missed payroll and headcount has dwindled. At its high point, LoanSnap employed more than 100. After layoffs and attrition, that number has diminished to less than 50, according to a source.\n\u201cThe current state is a result of terrible leadership, overspending on futility, and institutional investors falling for the charming facade that Karl can show,\u201d one former employee, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation, told TechCrunch. The person\u2019s identity is known to TechCrunch.\nGiven the scope of the company\u2019s problems beginning in 2021, the situation begs the question of why investors poured money into the company as late as 2023 \u2014 and what will happen next.\nReid Hoffman was not available for comment, and his office declined comment. (LoanSnap is not a Greylock Partners investment, the VC firm confirmed.) Virgin Group, Mantis VC, and Baseline Ventures also did not respond to requests for comment.\nJacob and Carroll, who are LoanSnap\u2019s CEO and CTO, respectively, did not respond to multiple requests for comments over several days, via email and texts. LoanSnap\u2019s press line deferred to the CEO in the matter and declined to offer comment.\nCreditors sue, agencies fine LoanSnap\nIn 2021, LoanSnap originated nearly 1,300 loans for a total value of almost $500 million, according to data filed with federal regulators \u2014 both records for the startup. By 2023, LoanSnap reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that it had originated only 122 loans for the year (though the data may not be final.)\nDespite the record number of loans, trouble was already brewing in 2021. Legal documents show that in May 2021, the same month LoanSnap announced its $30 million Series B with investors like Hoffman, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Mortgagee Review Board entered into a settlement agreement with the company. While LoanSnap did not admit to wrongdoing, the agency alleged that it violated Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requirements for failing to notify the FHA of an operating loss that exceeded 20% of its fiscal 2019 quarter-end net worth. It agreed to pay a $25,000 fine.\nSince 2021, at least three complaints have been filed against LoanSnap with the Better Business Bureau, and the company now has an F rating. Those complaints allege that the startup charged non-refundable fees and then failed to close on loans in a timely manner or failed to pay taxes from an escrow account. Additionally, in four complaints filed to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and reviewed by TechCrunch, consumers accused LoanSnap of selling a paid-in-full loan to another lender instead of properly closing it out, misleading consumers about mortgage approvals and shorting escrow accounts.\nBetween December 2022 and May 2024, at least seven creditors sued LoanSnap, and the company went through at least three CFOs, a source says. Near the end of 2022, Baseline Ventures\u2019 Steve Anderson stepped down from the board, according to someone familiar with the matter.\nFour of the lawsuits were from vendors claiming that the startup had fallen behind or completely stopped making contractual payments for services. LoanSnap has not yet filed a formal response with the courts for any of these suits, according to public records.\nFor instance, Wells Fargo filed a lawsuit in August 2023 for $431,000, alleging a loan it bought from LoanSnap violated the bank\u2019s income-to-debt-ratio policies. Because LoanSnap defaulted on the lawsuit (meaning it failed to respond in a timely manner), the judge ordered LoanSnap to pay.\nIn mid-2023, LoanSnap was facing a California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation investigation stemming from a complaint filed against it, and the company was fending off threatened litigation from at least one investor, according to records viewed by TechCrunch. (A spokesperson for the California Department of Financial Protection said it \u201cdoes not comment on investigations even to confirm or deny their existence.\u201d)\nThen, 2024 brought more legal troubles. In January, Connecticut\u2019s Department of Banking alleged the company was partaking in \u201csystemic unlicensed mortgage loan\u201d activity by employing unlicensed people. One employee told TechCrunch that the company was eager to hire those without much mortgage experience, with the idea of training them so they could one day get licenses.\nConnecticut also claimed that LoanSnap violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the SAFE Act, and the Fair Lending Act, among other state statutes, and threatened to revoke its license. Ultimately, LoanSnap paid a $75,000 fine without admitting fault and promised not to use unlicensed people for mortgage loan officer work in the state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big deal for them to threaten that,\u201d said Andrew Narod, a partner in the Banking and Financial Services Practice Group at the law firm Bradley. But Narod noted that the settlement wasn\u2019t \u201cparticularly onerous,\u201d adding, \u201cPay $75,000 and stop doing illegal things, which, candidly, really should have been the business model from the start.\u201d\nIn February, LoanSnap was sued by its Costa Mesa landlord, who alleged the company stopped paying rent and owed nearly $405,000. When LoanSnap didn\u2019t answer the suit, the judge ruled that it defaulted on the complaint, and the landlord was given the OK to evict LoanSnap in mid-May, according to court filings. (LoanSnap had a second office in San Francisco, though it is unclear if that office is still in use.)\nIn May, a new suit was filed. A tax company that loaned LoanSnap $5 million alleges that LoanSnap stopped making payments and owes more than $900,000.\nAnother VC invests millions in 2023\nMany of these lawsuits were filed in late 2023. But even before then, internal problems were clear: LoanSnap\u2019s finances had seen trouble, according to the FHA settlement; it had gone through layoffs; complaints had been filed to the BBB and the CFPB; and a known Silicon VC had, internal sources say, resigned from the board.\nStill, in July 2023, LoanSnap raised another $19 million in venture funding from new investor Fort\u00e9 Ventures, according to Pitchbook. (Fort\u00e9 Ventures did not respond to a request for comment.)\nOne employee attributes the company\u2019s venture fundraising success to CEO Jacob.\nJacob has the kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that attracts Valley VCs, having founded and exited multiple startups since 1997, when he sold a company called Dimension X to Microsoft. His LoanSnap bio proudly says he\u2019s \u201craised 23 rounds of financing\u201d and \u201cgenerated hundreds of millions of dollars in investor returns.\u201d His co-founder Carroll has also had repeat successes. He\u2019s a former Microsoft research engineer who launched three previous startups and sold two of them.\nBut many questions remain, such as where all the millions that LoanSnap raised went. The employees we spoke to don\u2019t have answers. When times were good in 2021, and headcount was at its highest, Jacob engaged in expenditures like authorizing an expensive open-bar holiday party for employees in 2021 at a beachside resort. One year, he gifted employees with Meta Portals and hosted a party in Denver for the Web3 ETH event.\nThe company was also operating two offices, both in pricey rental areas. The rent in Costa Mesa (from which it was evicted) was around $55,000 a month, and the office in San Francisco charged at least $30,000 a month rent, according to court documents obtained by TechCrunch.\nEmployees were told that the multimillion-dollar Newport Beach town house where Jacob and Carroll stayed when visiting the Costa Mesa office was also owned by the company. LoanSnap hosted its 2022 holiday party there.\nDespite all of the now-obvious problems, LoanSnap is still earning public accolades from investors, the media, and industry players.\nIn mid-May, Newsweek named LoanSnap among its list of America\u2019s Best Online Lenders, and one of its VCs, True Ventures, applauded the startup on LinkedIn for the inclusion. That same month, LoanSnap and Visa announced that LoanSnap had joined Visa\u2019s fintech program, which helps startups use its payment programs.\nAnd just last month, LoanSnap announced it entered into Nvidia\u2019s free Inception program, which gives benefits to AI startups. One former employee called these recent announcements odd, as the company appears to be trying to either pivot or move on as if nothing is wrong.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not hard to find numerous lawsuits and complaints, some of them from governmental agencies, with a quick Google search,\u201d the employee said, wondering how Nvidia and Visa let LoanSnap into the programs.\nTrue Ventures and Visa did not respond to our request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, employees who have not yet quit feel stuck, unsure if some version of the company will arise from the ashes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no communication, no accountability,\u201d the employee said. \u201cThat makes people nervous.\u201d\nThis article was updated to clarify where numerical data was sourced from.\"\n\nResponse:",
