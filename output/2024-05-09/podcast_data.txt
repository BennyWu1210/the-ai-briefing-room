Microsoft’s new Xbox mobile gaming store is launching in July
description0:
Microsoft has been talking about plans for an Xbox mobile gaming store for a couple of years now, and the company now plans to launch it in July. Speaking at the Bloomberg Technology Summit earlier today, Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed the launch date and how Microsoft is going to avoid Apple’s strict App Store rules.
“We’re going to start by bringing our own first-party portfolio to [the Xbox mobile store], so you’re going to see games like Candy Crush show up in that experience, games like Minecraft,” says Bond. “We’re going to start on the web, and we’re doing that because that really allows us to have it be an experience that’s accessible across all devices, all countries, no matter what and independent of the policies of closed ecosystem stores.”
The store will be focused on first-party mobile games from Microsoft’s various studios, which include huge hits like Call of Duty: Mobile and Candy Crush Saga. Bond says the company will extend this to partners at some point in the future, too.
While games will naturally be part of the store, it sounds like the key parts of the Xbox experience will also be available. Bond argues there isn’t a gaming platform and store experience that “goes truly across devices — where who you are, your library, your identity, your rewards travel with you versus being locked to a single ecosystem.” So Microsoft is trying to build that with its Xbox mobile store.
Microsoft had also been building this store in anticipation of companies like Apple and Google being forced to open up their mobile app stores, but it’s clear the software giant isn’t willing to wait on the Digital Markets Act to shake out in Europe or any potential action in the US.
A web-only mobile store will be challenging to pull off, and it’s not immediately clear how Microsoft will position this as an alternative to these mobile games already existing on rival app stores. Bond says Microsoft will “extend” beyond the web, hinting that it could eventually launch a true rival to Google and Apple’s mobile app stores at some point soon.

Apple plans to use M2 Ultra chips in the cloud for AI
description1:
Apple plans to start its foray into generative AI by offloading complex queries to M2 Ultra chips running in data centers before moving to its more advanced M4 chips.
Bloomberg reports that Apple plans to put its M2 Ultra on cloud servers to run more complex AI queries, while simple tasks are processed on devices. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Apple wanted to make custom chips to bring to data centers to ensure security and privacy in a project the publication says is called Project ACDC, or Apple Chips in Data Center. But the company now believes its existing processors already have sufficient security and privacy components.
The chips will be deployed to Apple’s data centers and eventually to servers run by third parties. Apple runs its own servers across the United States and has been working on a new center in Waukee, Iowa, which it first announced in 2017.
While Apple has not moved as fast on generative AI as competitors like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, the company has been putting out research on the technology. In December, Apple’s machine learning research team released MLX, a machine learning framework that can make AI models run efficiently on Apple silicon. The company has also been releasing other research around AI models that hint at what AI could look like on its devices and how existing products, like Siri, may get an upgrade.

Roblox shares drop 22% as company cuts annual bookings forecast on muted player spending
description2:
Roblox cut its annual bookings forecast on Thursday, in a sign that people were dialing back on spending within its video-gaming platform amid an uncertain economic outlook and elevated levels of inflation.
Roblox shares closed 22% lower Thursday.
The lowered forecast marks the latest downbeat report from the gaming industry, which has laid off hundreds of employees and shut studios this year to cope with declining demand.
Electronic Arts also gave a weak revenue forecast earlier this week.
Roblox now expects full-year bookings to be between $4 billion and $4.10 billion, down from its earlier forecast of $4.14 billion to $4.28 billion. Its second-quarter bookings forecast of $870 million to $900 million was also below estimates.
The company said it was conservative with its second-quarter forecast as the Easter holiday, a period of high engagement on its platform, was during the first quarter this year compared with the second quarter a year earlier.
The gaming industry is grappling with lower engagement, which is expected to keep growth in the PC and console market below pre-pandemic levels through 2026, according to research firm Newzoo.
The number of hours gamers aged 13 or more spent on Roblox's platform grew by 19% in the first quarter, the lowest growth rate for the company in about two years.
"That's not unusual," Roblox Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie said, adding that the company was adding a lot of older gamers who take a while to get settled and spend more time on the platform.
Roblox has also turned to digital ads to diversify its revenue. Earlier this month, it started displaying virtual billboards featuring content from brands such as Walmart and Warner Bros Discovery to users on its platform.
Roblox will build the infrastructure for the ad platform in 2024 and start providing forecast for ad revenue in 2025, Guthrie added.

House committee seeks Microsoft's Brad Smith for cybersecurity hearing
description3:
Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, speaks at Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, on May 8, 2024.
A House committee wants Microsoft 's top lawyer, Brad Smith, to attend a hearing this month on exploits of the company's software that resulted in hackers obtaining U.S. government officials' emails.
Politicians regularly request that technology companies send their leaders to Washington. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta and TikTok have all answered questions from members of Congress in recent years. Microsoft, the world's most valuable public company, sells subscriptions to email software that's pervasive in business and government, making it an obvious target for hackers.
A proposed hearing before the House Committee on Homeland Security, at 10 a.m. ET on May 22 in Washington, would go over Microsoft's response to China's breach of U.S. government officials' email accounts, which the company disclosed last summer. The attack involved accounts belonging to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., and Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China.
But Smith might not necessarily show up at the time the committee asked about in a letter it sent him on Thursday.
"We're always committed to providing Congress with information that is important to the nation's security, and we look forward to discussing the specifics of the best time and way to do this," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Thursday.
Last month, the Cyber Safety Review Board said in a 34-page report on the attack that "Microsoft's customers would benefit from its CEO and board of directors directly focusing on the company's security culture."
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella directed employees to put security first in a memo last week. The company announced operational changes that address shortcomings that the independent federal board identified in the report.
Charlie Bell, executive vice president for security, said the Microsoft would "improve the accuracy, effectiveness, transparency, and velocity of public messaging and customer engagement" after the board expressed concern about the company not correcting an error in a corporate blog post for months.
In January, Microsoft reported another cyberattack. This time, Russian intelligence gained access to some of the company's top executives' email accounts.
Committee chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., and Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in their letter inviting Smith to the hearing that they were encouraged by the company's plans to overhaul its security practices. But they said the company's failure to stop attacks put Americans at risk.
"Given the gravity of the issues discussed above and the need for thorough examination and oversight, it is critical that you appear before the committee," Green and Thompson wrote.

China's SMIC warns of fierce chip competition as it misses profit estimates

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation on Friday warned of intense competition in the chip industry after its first-quarter profit missed expectations.
"Competition in the industry has been increasingly fierce and the pricing for commodity products basically follows the market trends," SMIC said on Friday during the firm's earnings call.
"The company fulfills its [long-term view] through constructing quality technology platforms that leap here in mainland China by one to two generations," said SMIC.
SMIC, China's biggest contract chip manufacturer, is seen as critical to Beijing's ambitions of cutting foreign reliance in its domestic semiconductor industry as the U.S. continues to curb China's tech power. SMIC lags behind Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, according to analysts.
The company's first-quarter net income plunged 68.9% from a year earlier to $71.79 million, compared with LSEG analysts' average estimate of $80.49 million.
Gross margin slid to 13.7% in the quarter – the lowest the firm has ever recorded in nearly 12 years – according to LSEG data.
Revenue for the first quarter was $1.75 billion, up 19.7% from a year earlier, as customers stocked up on chips, SMIC said. This handily beat LSEG estimate of $1.69 billion.
"In the first quarter, the IC [integrated circuits] industry was still in the recovery stage and customer inventory gradually improved. Compared to three months ago, we have noticed that our global customers are more willing to build up inventory," SMIC said on Friday.
Customers are building up inventory to brace for competition and respond to market demand, the firm said, adding that it was unable to fulfil a few rush orders in the first quarter as some production lines were running at near maximum capacity."

我是wall-e，这是周四5月9日的ai简报。微软公司宣布，其备受期待的xbox移动游戏商店将于7月正式上线。在今天早些时候的彭博科技峰会上，xbox总裁sarah bond透露了启动日期，并详述了微软如何打算避开苹果严格的app store规则。bond表示，“我们将从首发自家的游戏组合开始，所以你将会在该平台上看到像《糖果粉碎》和《我的世界》这样的游戏。”商店将专注于微软旗下各个工作室的首个移动游戏，其中包括像《使命召唤：手机版》和《糖果粉碎传奇》这样的大热门游戏。

苹果公司计划开启其生成式ai之旅，最初将复杂查询任务委托给在数据中心运行的m2 ultra芯片处理，随后转移到更先进的m4芯片上。据彭博社报道，苹果计划将m2 ultra芯片部署在云服务器上，以运行更复杂的ai查询，同时简单任务在设备上处理。

roblox的股票在公司削减了年度预订预测后，周四下跌了22%。这是因为在不确定的经济前景和高通胀水平下，人们在其视频游戏平台上的消费有所减少。这一下调的预测标志着游戏行业最新的低迷报告，今年该行业已经裁员数百人并关闭工作室以应对需求下降。

众议院委员会寻求微软公司的高级律师brad smith出席本月关于公司软件漏洞利用的听证会，这导致黑客获取了美国政府官员的电子邮件。为了回应中国对美国政府官员电子邮件账户的攻击，众议院国土安全委员会提议于5月22日上午10点在华盛顿举行听证会。

中国的半导体制造国际公司（smic）在其第一季度利润低于预期后，警告说芯片行业的竞争非常激烈。smic表示，“行业竞争日益激烈，商品产品的定价基本上遵循市场趋势。”这是作为北京减少对国内半导体业外国依赖志向的关键公司，smic被视为对抗美国继续限制中国科技实力的一部分。
