Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Boeing launched its first crewed Starliner mission on June 5 for what was supposed to be an eight-day sojourn on the International Space Station (ISS). The mission is meant to be the final, crucial hurdle before the capsule is certified to conduct regular astronaut transportation flights to and from the ISS.\nBut in the final phase of its approach to the station, the Starliner spacecraft experienced a series of technical issues \u2014 the failure of several thrusters and helium leaks in the propulsion system.\nAfter about an hour\u2019s delay, engineers were able to bring four of the five malfunctioning thrusters back online (there are 28 thrusters on Starliner). But since that point, NASA and Boeing have been engaged in a root cause investigation into the issues, including data analysis of the thrusters onboard Starliner and ground testing of replica thrusters at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico to study performance under conditions similar to what the spacecraft would experience when it departs the station.\n\u201cOur big concern is having a successful de-orbit burn \u2014 making sure that the [propulsion] system works just the way it needs to all the way through the de-orbit burn,\u201d NASA associate administrator Ken Bowersox said during a press conference earlier this month.\nNASA has acknowledged that officials inside the organization disagree on the correct course of action moving forward. Boeing, for its part, has made public proclamations on the safety of Starliner and the thoroughness of the test campaign.\nSaturday\u2019s high-stakes decision will lay the debate to rest. If the agency determines that Starliner is not safe enough to fly home, it would undock from the station empty, and Williams and Wilmore would return onboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. (Starliner could still safely return to the surface autonomously in this scenario, but the optics aren\u2019t great.)\nNASA has already delayed the launch of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission to the ISS by one month, to September 24; Williams and Wilmore would use that vehicle to return to Earth at the end of its stay \u2014 in February 2025.\nIf NASA determines that Starliner should return empty, NASA could bump two astronauts from the Crew-9 manifest to make room for Williams and Wilmore\u2019s return. The other option on the table is for one Starliner astronaut to return with Crew-8 and another with Crew-9, though this would be the first time a SpaceX Dragon flies five crew members at one time.\nUnlike Starliner, Dragon has proved its bona fides to NASA. The spacecraft has become critical to the space agency, as it is the sole American-made mode of transportation for astronauts (among other things, global politics make use of Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsule and facilities impossible). SpaceX\u2019s Dragon completed its crewed certification mission back in 2020 and has since conducted eight crewed missions for NASA and a handful more private human spaceflight missions. Starliner is the only credible competition right now, and if it were removed from the board, Dragon would be even more in demand.\nNASA leadership, including its head administrator Bill Nelson, will hold what\u2019s known as an \u201cagency-level review\u201d of the data, also called a Flight Readiness Review, on Saturday and hold a press conference shortly after.\nMuch is on the line for both NASA and Boeing. Boeing has poured over $1.5 billion into its Starliner program, and it\u2019s unclear whether the aerospace giant would continue with its development should this test mission result in a failure. NASA, for its part, has paid Boeing $4.2 billion over the years for development of the spacecraft, with the hopes of having two commercial astronaut transportation providers online. If its decision Saturday results in one being discontinued, it could make for some awkward budget conversations.\nEither way, Saturday\u2019s decision will likely be seen as a watershed moment in privately developed spaceflight and public-private partnerships. Tune in at 10 a.m. Pacific time or watch for our coverage on Saturday.\n\ntitle1:\nFord pivots on EVs, Waymo doubles its robotaxi ridership and Canoo leaves California\ndescription1:\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\nMonterey Car Week is a wrap. And while it is still steeped in tradition, the collection of parties, auctions and car shows that were held throughout the Monterey Peninsula is pushing deeper into EVs and tech. And it\u2019s getting younger. As TechCrunch contributor Abigail Bassett noted, a heavy dose of Silicon Valley\u2019s software developers and founders added to the scenery this year. Check out her article on the most interesting EVs at Monterey Car Week.\nDuring the event, Rimac unveiled its Nevera R, an upgraded version of its Nevera hypercar that somehow has more power than its predecessor. TechCrunch also spent some time with new Porsche North America CEO Timo Resch, who spoke about the upcoming all-electric Macan EV and how the German automaker will survive the turbulent market. Then there was Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath, who shared his concerns about the topsy-turvy political environment, the Polestar 3 and how the company will become self-sustaining \u2014 and less capital reliant on its biggest shareholders Geely Holding Group and Volvo.\nThere was a lot more than the Monterey Car Week, though \u2014 so let\u2019s go!\nA little bird\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin\nA little birdie told us late last week that Canoo announced in an all-hands meeting plans to close its Los Angeles office \u2014 the company\u2019s original headquarters dating back to its founding in late 2017. The company\u2019s new headquarters will be in Justin, Texas, where it has maintained a corporate office since around the time chairman and CEO Tony Aquila took over a few years ago.\nThis all comes a few years after Canoo announced \u2014 but eventually abandoned \u2014 plans to move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas, as it was courting Walmart.\nCanoo quietly tucked into its quarterly SEC filing last week that it is offering \u201crelocation to approximately 137 employees out of the 194 employees located at the Torrance Facility.\u201d The relocations will either be in Texas or Oklahoma \u2014 the latter is where Canoo has been trying for years to stand up a manufacturing facility. The remaining staff will be laid off.\nRegardless of how many accept the relocation, all of those California jobs are done. The LA office will close October 15. Canoo reported 651 employees at the end of 2023, down from a peak of nearly 1,000 in late 2022.\nCanoo employees have long expected Aquila to close the LA office \u2014 especially after co-founder and chief design officer Richard Kim left the company in April 2023. The company has struggled to make progress getting to meaningful production volumes and has pivoted its business model multiple times under Aquila\u2019s watch.\nGot a tip for us?

TC editor Devin Coldewey wrote about how BeyondMath\u2019s \u201cdigital wind tunnel\u201d put a physics-based AI simulation to work on F1 cars.\nRe:Build Manufacturing, a Massachusetts startup focused on industrial manufacturing in the U.S., raised $120 million in a round led by General Catalyst.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nAutonomous vehicles\nWaymo said it\u2019s now giving more than 100,000 paid robotaxi rides every week across its three main commercial markets in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Context: That is double the figure it shared publicly a few months ago. One other item worth noting in my story: Waymo has 778 robotaxis under its deployment permit in the state, according to a Freedom of Information Act request from the California Department of Revenue. It\u2019s unclear if some of those vehicles are operating in Phoenix.\nIn other Waymo news \u2026 Remember the honking problem that software engineer Sophia Tung captured via a livestream of the parking lot where Waymo robotaxis come and go? Well, it was fixed and then it popped again. But now, Waymo says, it has been fixed for good. Waymo Director of Product and Operations Vishay Nihalani came onto Tung\u2019s livestream and answered questions about the robotaxis and the honking, among other things. I\u2019ll share some tidbits in next week\u2019s issue of TechCrunch Mobility.\nElectric vehicles, charging & batteries\nGogoro, the Taiwanese electric two-wheeler maker, deferred its highly ambitious plans for India. In the meantime, the company has started a bike-taxi pilot with aggregator Rapido to test its vehicles before their commercial release.\nRivian launched a smaller $1,400 camp kitchen. History lesson: Rivian showed the first prototype \u2014 a far larger, more expensive kitchen \u2014 more than five years ago. This time, customers can actually buy it!\nUber has hired Rebecca Tinucci, who led Tesla\u2019s Supercharger team, as its new global Head of Sustainability.\nVolkswagen continues to creep slowly toward selling its electric minivan in the United States. We now know that the 2025 ID. Buzz will set buyers back $59,995 for the Pro S trim, which includes seven seats, rear-wheel drive and a 91 kWh battery that provides an EPA-estimated 234 miles of range.\nFuture of flight\nSkyryse, a startup developing a universal operating system for flight, opened a new facility at the Hawthorne Airport in California.\nIn-car tech\nGeneral Motors cut around 1,000 software workers globally. I happen to be in Detroit this week visiting GM to learn more about the Sierra EV and its software efforts. Talk about timing! These cuts should be viewed as a restructuring \u2014 and an essential one if GM hopes to avoid problems like it had last year with the Chevrolet Blazer EV. Stay tuned for more on this.\nThis week\u2019s wheels\nWhat is \u201cThis week\u2019s wheels\u201d? It\u2019s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we\u2019re testing, whether it\u2019s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle. Future vehicles include the Nissan Leaf, some e-bikes and the GMC Sierra EV.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle DeepMind staff call for end to military contracts\ndescription2:\nIn May 2024, around 200 employees at Google DeepMind (representing roughly 5 percent of the division) signed a letter urging the company to end its contracts with military organizations, expressing concerns that its AI technology was being used for warfare, Time magazine reported.\nThe letter states that employee concerns aren\u2019t \u201cabout the geopolitics of any particular conflict,\u201d but it does link out to Time\u2019s reporting on Google\u2019s defense contract with the Israeli military, known as Project Nimbus. The letter also points to reports that the Israeli military uses AI for mass surveillance and to select targets in its bombing campaign in Gaza, with Israeli weapon firms mandated by the government to purchase cloud services from Google and Amazon.\nDo you work at Google? I\u2019d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.\nThe use of AI in warfare has spread rapidly, pushing some technologists who build related systems to speak out. But Google also made a specific commitment: when it acquired DeepMind in 2014, the lab\u2019s leaders required that their AI technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes.\n\u201cAny involvement with military and weapon manufacturing impacts our position as leaders in ethical and responsible AI, and goes against our mission statement and stated AI Principles,\u201d the letter that circulated inside Google DeepMind says.\nAs Time reports, the letter from DeepMind staff urges leadership to investigate claims that Google cloud services are being used by militaries and weapons manufacturers, to cut off military access to DeepMind\u2019s technology, and to establish a new governance body to prevent future use of the AI by military clients.\n\ntitle3:\nCruise\u2019s robotaxis are coming to the Uber app in 2025\ndescription3:\nCruise, General Motors\u2019 self-driving subsidiary, said it has signed a multi-year partnership with ride-hailing giant Uber to bring its robotaxis to the ride-hailing platform in 2025.\nCruise didn\u2019t say when exactly customers would see its vehicles on Uber\u2019s platform, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch that this partnership will follow the re-launch of Cruise\u2019s own driverless service.\nThe announcement provides another indicator that Cruise is preparing to reintroduce its robotaxis to public roads after one struck a pedestrian last October. (A human-driven vehicle hit the pedestrian first, sending her into the robotaxi\u2019s path.) It also follows Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s recent comments positioning the ride-hail company as the ideal go-to-market partner for autonomous vehicle companies looking to commercialize.\nUber has already partnered with Waymo on the ride-hail side of its operations. Waymo vehicles have been available on the Uber app in Phoenix since October 2023.\nBefore Cruise\u2019s safety incident \u2014 which resulted in it losing its permits to operate autonomously in California and grounding its U.S. fleet \u2014 the company had been expanding into new territories at a rapid clip. Cruise was charging for autonomous rides in San Francisco, Austin, Houston and Phoenix, and had launched driverless testing in Miami.\nCruise started manually testing its robotaxis again in Phoenix in April 2024, and has since expanded that testing to Dallas and Houston.\nThe company is also playing nice with regulators as it works toward a re-launch. Earlier today, Cruise announced it recalled its fleet of 1,194 AVs to resolve a federal safety probe into an issue with unexpected braking. In June, Cruise agreed to pay a $112,500 fine to California regulators for mishandling communications in regards to the incident last fall. The settlement put Cruise in a position to restart operations in the state.\nCruise\u2019s partnership with Uber follows statements from Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi earlier this month on the subject: \u201cUber is uniquely positioned to offer tremendous value for AV players looking to deploy their technology at scale,\u201d said Khosrowshahi during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call on August 6. \u201cWhile the operation of a ride-hail network may seem simple, our technology obscures a huge amount of complexity.\u201d\nKhosrowshahi went on to note that AVs are expensive assets, but Uber could boost utilization for them.\n\u201cUber can provide enormous demand without AV players needing to invest capital toward acquiring customers or building the marketplace tech that delivers reliability at the standard that consumers have come to expect,\u201d Khosrowshahi said.\nFor its food delivery arm, Uber has active partnerships with autonomous vehicle startup Nuro and sidewalk delivery robot companies Serve Robotics and Cartken. Uber also has partnerships with autonomous trucking companies Waabi and Aurora Innovation, although neither of those are operating fully autonomously (with no human driver behind the wheel) yet.\nUber likely has other potential deals to announce in the coming weeks and months. The company recently signed a deal with Chinese EV startup BYD to bring 100,000 new EVs onto the platform in markets outside the U.S. The two companies say they will collaborate on \u201cfuture BYD autonomous-capable vehicles\u201d to be deployed on the Uber platform. BYD committed in June to a $14 billion investment into AV technology.\n\ntitle4:\nZoom stock has best day since 2022 on Q2 2025 results, raised guidance\ndescription4:\nZoom CEO Eric Yuan speaks at the Dropbox Work In Progress Conference in San Francisco on Sept. 25, 2019.\nZoom shares soared the most since November 2022 on Thursday after the video chat company reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter and raised its full-year guidance.\nThe stock rose 13% to close at $68.04. Shares are still down 5.4% for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 17% over that stretch.\nZoom said revenue in the quarter rose 2.1% from a year earlier to $1.16 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.15 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.39, ahead of the $1.21 average estimate.\nFor the full fiscal year, Zoom now expects revenue of $4.63 billion to $4.64 billion. The last time Zoom provided guidance, the company said the top end of the expected range was $4.62 billion.\nWhile Zoom has struggled to reaccelerate growth following the slowdown from the pandemic surge, the company has stabilized, reducing customer churn and bolstering its contact center business.
