 Hackers are threatening to publish a huge stolen sanctions and financial crimes watchlist
Hackers are threatening to publish a huge stolen sanctions and financial crimes watchlist The stolen World-Check database contains 5.3 million records
A financially motivated criminal hacking group says it has stolen a confidential database containing millions of records that companies use for screening potential customers for links to sanctions and financial crime.
The hackers, which call themselves GhostR, said they stole 5.3 million records from the World-Check screening database in March and are threatening to publish the data online.
World-Check is a screening database used for “know your customer” checks (or KYC), allowing companies to determine if prospective customers are high risk or potential criminals, such as people with links to money laundering or who are under government sanctions. The hackers told TechCrunch that they stole the data from a Singapore-based firm with access to the World-Check database, but did not name the firm.
A portion of the stolen data, which the hackers shared with TechCrunch, includes individuals who were sanctioned as recently as this year.
Simon Henrick, a spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange Group, which maintains the database, told TechCrunch: “This was not a security breach of LSEG/our systems. The incident involves a third party’s data set, which includes a copy of the World-Check data file. This was illegally obtained from the third party’s system. We are liaising with the affected third party, to ensure our data is protected and ensuring that any appropriate authorities are notified.”
LSEG did not name the third-party company, but did not dispute the amount of data stolen.
The portion of stolen data seen by TechCrunch contains records on thousands of people, including current and former government officials, diplomats, and private companies whose leaders are considered “politically exposed people,” who are at a higher risk of involvement in corruption or bribery. The list also contains individuals accused of involvement in organized crime, suspected terrorists, intelligence operatives and a European spyware vendor.
The data varies by record. The database contains names, passport numbers, Social Security numbers, online crypto account identifiers and bank account numbers, and more.
World-Check is currently owned by the London Stock Exchange Group following a $27 billion deal to buy financial data provider Refinitiv in 2021. LSEG collects information from public sources, including sanctions lists, government sources and news outlets, then provides the database as a subscription to companies for conducting customer due diligence.
But privately run databases, like World-Check, are known to contain errors that can affect entirely innocent people with no nexus or connection to crime but whose information is stored in these databases.
In 2016, an older copy of the World-Check database leaked online following a security lapse at a third-party company with access to the data, including a former advisor to the U.K. government that World-Check had applied a “terrorism” label to his name. Banking giant HSBC shut down bank accounts belonging to several prominent British Muslims after the World-Check database branded them with “terrorism” tags.
A spokesperson for the U.K.’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, did not immediately comment on the breach.

Tesla still plans to build 1,800-mile charging corridor for semi trucks despite Biden funding snub
Tesla is pushing forward with a plan to build an electric big rig charging corridor stretching from Texas to California, despite being snubbed by a lucrative federal funding program that’s part of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But the original scope of the project could still change, TechCrunch has learned.
The company had been seeking nearly $100 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Combined with around $24 million of its own money, Tesla wanted to build nine electric semi-truck charging stations between Laredo, Texas and Fremont, California.
The corridor, if built, would be a first-of-its-kind charging network that could enable both long-distance and regional electric trucking and help clean up a big chunk of the otherwise dirty transportation sector. Without it, though, Tesla’s promise to electrify heavy-duty trucking could fall even further behind schedule than it already is.
The project as pitched to the FHWA was called TESSERACT, which stands for “Transport Electrification Supporting Semis Operating in Arizona, California, and Texas,” according to a slide buried in a 964-page filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. (Tesla collaborated with SCAQMD on the application.)
But Tesla was not among the 47 recipients that the Biden administration announced in January. Collectively, those winners received $623 million to build electric vehicle charging and refueling stations across the country. This is despite Tesla winning around 13% of all other charging awards so far from the Infrastructure Act, though that has only netted the company around $17 million.
Rohan Patel, who left his VP position at Tesla this week as the company laid off 10% of its workforce, said in a message to TechCrunch that Tesla may turn to state funding opportunities, or future rounds of the CFI program. Some of the sites along the route “are no-brainers even without funding,” he said.
The 1,800-mile route would theoretically connect Tesla’s two North American vehicle factories, as well as one that is planned — but delayed — in Mexico. Each station was originally slated to be equipped with eight 750kW chargers for Tesla Semis, and four chargers open to other electric trucks. It’s unclear how effective it would be if the company was unable to build all nine stations, which are situated at roughly equal distances along the route.
About half of the Biden administration’s choices for the CFI funding focused on building out EV charging infrastructure in “urban and rural communities, including at convenient and high-use locations like schools, parks, libraries, multi-family housing, and more.”
The other half was dedicated to funding 11 “corridor” projects, including a number on the same I-10 corridor that makes up part of Tesla’s proposed route. That includes $70 million to the North Texas Council of Governments to build up to five hydrogen fueling stations for medium and heavy-duty trucks in the Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio areas.
“The project will help create a hydrogen corridor from southern California to Texas,” the Department of Transportation wrote in a statement in January.
“Funding hydrogen stations will go down as purely wasted money,” Patel told TechCrunch this week.
While he no longer speaks on behalf of Tesla, he also criticized funding hydrogen infrastructure when he was still with the company.
“Governments around the globe are wasting tax dollars on hydrogen for light/heavy duty infrastructure,” he wrote on X in February. “Like smoking, it’s never too late to quit.”
Funding isn’t the only challenge to the project. Another complicating factor could be Tesla’s recent restructuring.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company is now “balls to the wall for autonomy,” and has reportedly already sacrificed a planned low-cost EV in favor of making a purpose-built robotaxi the company’s priority. The Semi is years behind schedule, and Tesla has only built around 100 to date.
Despite all this, the Tesla Semi program is still slowly attracting customers. Just a few days after the restructuring, the head of the Semi program, Dan Priestley, announced via social media a new potential customer for the trucks. Priestley also said in March that Tesla has been using Semis to ship battery packs from Nevada to the Fremont factory.

Meta AI assistant comes to WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger
Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during Meta Connect event at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California on September 27, 2023.
Meta on Thursday announced its free artificial intelligence assistant, Meta AI, is rolling out across its social media platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. It's the company's biggest push into AI yet.
The assistant can answer questions, create animations and generate images, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video. Meta AI was built on the company's latest large language model called Meta Llama 3, which was also announced Thursday.
The AI tool is Meta's competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini but, in a unique twist, Meta has also partnered with Google and Microsoft to provide results from both companies' search engines.
"We believe that Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the video.
Shares of Meta closed up more than 1% Thursday.
Meta AI is built into the search box of the WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger apps so users can easily ask questions that can be answered through the new tool.

TikTok divest-or-ban legislation could suddenly be fast-tracked in the Senate
A bill that could oust TikTok from the US looked like it could linger for months in the Senate, even after the House overwhelmingly voted to approve it. But a move by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) could change that.
An updated version of the bill, which would enforce a ban of TikTok unless it divests from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, appears in a bill about sanctions on Russia and Iran. A separate bill that would prohibit data brokers from transferring US users’ information to foreign adversaries is also included. It’s part of a package on foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza. By combining the legislation, it could make the TikTok bill harder for the Senate to ignore.
The foreign aid bill still needs to be approved by the full House, but a vote is expected Saturday. After that, it would go to the Senate. President Joe Biden has already said he’d sign the measure into law if passed by both chambers.
Changes to the version of the TikTok bill that passed through the House are already winning the support of at least one key senator. The bill extends the timeline for a forced sale of TikTok from six months to nine and gives the president the discretion to extend that timeline another 90 days if there’s progress toward a deal.
Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA) said in a statement on Wednesday night that she’s “very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the Byte Dance divestment period from six months to a year. As I’ve said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.” Cantwell had previously been noncommittal about the legislation, saying at the time of its passage in the House that she wanted to find “a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties.” If moved on its own, the bill would need to pass through Cantwell’s committee before reaching the Senate floor.
The drive for TikTok to divest from its Chinese owner stems from the fear of US lawmakers and intelligence officials that China could access user information through the app or exert influence over Americans who spend hours on it each day. Part of the concern comes from a Chinese law that could compel companies based there to hand over internal information for the purpose of national security. But TikTok says it doesn’t store US user information in China.
The bill’s opponents worry it will have a chilling effect on US users’ speech and that it won’t hold up to legal challenges. Some say that a data privacy bill would better fix some of the controversies around TikTok.

Senate advances bill on FISA Section 702 reauthorization
The Senate is moving forward on a vote to reauthorize a controversial program that allows warrantless surveillance of foreign “targets.” Before voting on the reauthorization bill, senators had to vote on a cloture motion to begin voting. The cloture motion passed 67–32, just one day ahead of the program’s expiration.
Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is set to expire at midnight on April 19th, a deadline some senators emphasized as they urged their colleagues to vote in favor of reauthorization. “It’s hard to overstate either the importance — the gravity — of allowing it to sunset, yet we are 36 hours away from that happening,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said on the Senate floor. “I understand that some of my colleagues would like to amend the House passed bill and continue the process of debate and negotiation. Listen, there are things I’d like to change in the House bill as well. The choice before us as we think about amendments — this is the case — is pass this bill, or allow 702 to sunset.”
The House bill Warner was referring to, which passed on April 12th after three failed attempts, lacks an amendment that would require federal intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant before accessing Americans’ data. A bipartisan coalition of House members supported the amendment, which was narrowly defeated on a 212–212 vote.
Earlier in March, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced a companion warrant requirement in the Senate. (The Durbin amendment differs slightly from the failed House amendment in that it would require intelligence agencies to obtain FISA Title I orders or warrants before accessing Americans’ communications under Section 702 but not before querying for those communications.) Punchbowl News reports that the Biden administration has begun circulating a letter to senators claiming that the Durbin amendment “threatens national security.”
Although Warner urged the Senate to move quickly and without the warrant requirement amendment due to a looming expiration date, Section 702 would still be in place for another year even if the Senate votes against reauthorization. On April 5th, the FISA court granted a government request authorizing the program until April 2025.
“Under the statute, any ongoing activities can continue until the certification expires, which would be April 5th of next year,” Kia Hamadanchy, senior federal policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Verge. “It’s what I like to call a zombie certification, because the law is expired but the certification is ongoing.”
“It’s what I like to call a zombie certification, because the law is expired but the certification is ongoing.”
A separate amendment introduced by Reps. Mike Turner (R-OH) and Jim Himes (D-CT) expanding the definition of “electronic communications service (ECS) provider” did make it into the bill. Under the new amendment, ECS providers are now defined as “any service provider” that has “access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic communications.”
The White House has expressed support for the Turner-Himes amendment. On April 17th, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan urged the Senate to “reject mischaracterizations” of the amendment, which critics have said effectively turns Americans into spies for the government.
“It allows the government to force any American who installs, maintains, or repairs anything that transmits or stores communications to spy on the government’s behalf,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said in a statement after the House bill passed. “That means anyone with access to a server, a wire, a cable box, a wifi router, or a phone. It would be secret: the Americans receiving the government directives would be bound to silence, and there would be no court oversight.”
“I think the amendment could have been drafted better,” Warner said on the Senate floor before referencing a letter from Attorney General Merrick Garland pledging to interpret the amendment narrowly. “In that letter, the Attorney General says, and I quote, it would be unlawful under Section 702 to use the modified definition of ECSP [electronic communication service provider] to target any entity inside the United States, including, for example, any business, home, or place of worship.”
Andrew Crocker, the surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the ECSP amendment drastically expands the scope of which communications providers can be forced to assist the government’s surveillance efforts. “The Justice Department is playing word games when it says the amendment doesn’t change the ‘structure’ of 702 because the law prohibits targeting entities inside the United States,” Crocker told The Verge.
Garland’s pledge, he added, “isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on; if this amendment becomes law, the DOJ can and almost certainly will rely on it to conscript other providers who fit within its very broad scope.”
If reauthorized, Section 702 will be in place until 2026.Response:
