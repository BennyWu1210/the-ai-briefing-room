Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday June 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple shares close at record high after company unveils AI software\ndescription0:\nApple CEO Tim Cook gestures during the annual developer conference event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S., June 10, 2024.\nApple shares closed up 7% to a new record high of $207.15 per share on Tuesday, a day after the company announced its long-awaited push into artificial intelligence at its annual developer conference on Monday.\nApple introduced a range of new AI features during the event, including an overhaul of its voice assistant Siri, integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, a range of writing assistance tools and new customizable emojis. The company pitched the features as AI for the average person, though users will likely need to upgrade their iPhones to access the tools.\nWith Tuesday's share move, Apple bested its previous record from Dec. 14. The company's developer conference came as a welcome sign for investors who have been watching to see how Apple will capitalize on the ongoing AI boom.\nAnalysts from Morgan Stanley said Apple's AI features strongly position the company with \"the most differentiated consumer digital agent.\" Additionally, the analysts believe that the features will drive consumers to upgrade their iPhones, which should \"accelerate device replacement cycles.\"\nThey said Apple will still have to deliver when the AI features are first available in the fall, but they think the \"building blocks are in place for a return to growth and more sustained outperformance.\"\n\"Following a WWDC that delivered on the key details we were focused on heading into the event, we have even greater conviction that Apple is on the cusp of a multi-year product refresh that underpins our OW rating, $216 price target, and $270 bull case valuation,\" the analysts wrote in a note Tuesday.\nBank of America analysts were also optimistic about Apple's announcements, saying the features will lead to \"an upgrade cycle for AI-enabled IntelliPhones.\" The analysts maintained their buy rating on the stock due to the promise of a multiyear upgrade cycle, potential for gross margin upside and services growth.\nEvercore analysts said they came away from the conference with \"increased confidence\" in Apple's AI strategy, particularly because they believe it will push users to upgrade their devices.\n\"Restricting Apple Intelligence to iPhones sold within the last year adds to our conviction that AI can help kick off an iPhone super cycle,\" the analysts said in a note Monday.\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report\n\ntitle1:\nFTC Chair Lina Khan says the agency is going after the 'mob bosses' in Big Tech\ndescription1:\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission is focusing its efforts on going after Big Tech, according to FTC Chair Lina Khan, who spoke at TechCrunch\u2019s Strictly VC event in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.\nKhan said the agency is focused on going after the players that are doing the biggest harm, as opposed to just increasing the number of cases that it brings forward. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been important for me is to make sure that we\u2019re actually looking at where we see the biggest harm,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhere do we see players that are systematically driving these illegal behaviors? Being able to go after the \u2018mob boss\u2019 is going to be more effective than going after the henchman at the bottom.\u201d\nThe comments come a few days after The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC is opening up an antitrust probe of Microsoft over its partnership with Inflection AI. The FTC and the Department of Justice have struck a deal to investigate Microsoft, Open AI and Nvidia over potential antitrust violations, according to The New York Times.\nThe FTC has also gone after Meta, Amazon, Google, Apple and others over the past years.\nKhan says the FTC wants to be effective in its enforcement strategy, which is why it has been taking on lawsuits that \u201cgo up against some of the big guys.\u201d If the FTC is successful, it can have a beneficial impact on the marketplace, she said.\nThe types of cases that the FTC selects can act as a deterrent, she said, noting that the FTC is already seeing that happen. \u201cFive or six or seven years ago, when you were thinking about a potential deal, antitrust risk, or even the antitrust analysis, was nowhere near the top of the conversation. And now, it is up front and center. And so, for an enforcer, if you\u2019re having companies think about that legal issue on the front end, that\u2019s a really good thing, because we\u2019re not having to spend as many public resources taking on deals.\u201d\nSpeaking to an audience of startup founders and VCs who see exits as a big path, Khan noted that what the law really prohibits is an exit or acquisition that\u2019s going to fortify a monopoly or allow a dominant firm to form a competitive threat.\nKhan said that in any given year, the FTC sees up to 3,000 merger filings reported to the agency and that around 2% of those deals get a second look by the government.\n\u201cSo you have 98% of deals that, for the most part, are going through,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are a startup or a founder that is eager for an acquisition as an exit, a world in which you have five or six or seven or eight potential suitors, I would think, is a better world in which you just have one or two, right? And so, actually promoting more competition at that level to ensure that startups have you know more of a fair chance of getting a better valuation, I think would be beneficial as well.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nBeReal is being acquired by mobile apps and games company Voodoo for \u20ac500M\ndescription2:\nVoodoo, a French mobile apps and games publisher, has acquired BeReal for \u20ac500 million. As part of the acquisition, BeReal co-founder and CEO Alexis Barreyat will leave the company after a transition period. Aymeric Roff\u00e9, the CEO of Wizz, one of Voodoo\u2019s social media apps, will take over as BeReal\u2019s CEO.\nBeReal, which has more than 40 million active users, gained popularity during the pandemic. Despite its early success, the company has been struggling to grow its user base, and was looking for a buyer as it was running out of funding.\n\u201cBeReal achieved incredible user loyalty and growth, showing there is a universal need to share real, unfiltered experiences with close friends,\u201d said Alexandre Yazdi, Voodoo co-founder and CEO, in a press release. \u201cWe are very excited to bring our teams together and leverage Voodoo\u2019s know-how and differentiated technologies to scale BeReal into the iconic social network for authenticity.\u201d\nI\u2019m thrilled to announce that @BeReal_App is now part of @VoodooPlatform.@BeReal_App is the most successful social app launched in nearly a decade.\nThey have created a unique behavior: sharing authentic content with true friends, and a visionary app, where every user is an\u2026 pic.twitter.com/I2KkM4NWPN \u2014 Alexandre Yazdi (@YazdiAlexandre) June 11, 2024\nVoodoo says the acquisition will give BeReal the opportunity to build and release new features and refocus on growth through organic and paid marketing across markets. Voodoo plans to do so by leveraging its experience of building and growing mobile products, like it did with Helix Jump, Mob Control, Block Jam 3D and Wizz.\nBeReal was founded in 2019 with the mission of fostering genuine, unedited connections during a time of flawless picture-perfect Instagram posts and Stories. On BeReal, users receive a push notification each day prompting them to post they\u2019re up within a two-minute window. The platform\u2019s lack of \u201clikes\u201d or \u201cfollowers\u201d creates a space for sharing real moments without the pressure to perform.\nAlthough BeReal started with a simple premise, the company rolled out a number of additional features over the past year, such as groups, mentions, multiple posts per day, pinned posts and a \u201cfriends of friends\u201d feed.\n\u201cVoodoo has a proven track record of driving significant growth in mobile apps,\u201d Barreyat said in the press release. \u201cTheir resources and expertise will help bring BeReal on a sustainable growth path while continuing to deliver on its mission to create an authentic world that keeps you connected with the people you really care about.\u201d\nVoodoo says BeReal is one of the most popular social networks in its three key markets: the United States, Japan and France. The company says half of the users in these countries use the app at least six days a week.\n\ntitle3:\nGM gives Cruise $850M lifeline as it relaunches robotaxis in Houston\ndescription3:\nGeneral Motors is investing $850 million into Cruise as the autonomous vehicle subsidiary slowly makes its way back to testing in Phoenix, Dallas and, as of Tuesday, Houston.\nGM\u2019s CFO Paul Jacobson announced the capital infusion onstage at Deutsche Bank\u2019s Global Automotive Industry Conference on Tuesday.\n\u201cThis will help bridge Cruise funding until we can find the right long-term capital efficient strategy, including potential new partnerships and external funding,\u201d Tiffany Testo, a spokesperson for the company, told TechCrunch. She declined to elaborate on the types of new partnerships or how much money Cruise hopes to raise.\nThe new investment comes less than a year after GM told investors it would slash spending on Cruise in 2024 by \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars, following a series of safety incidents that culminated in Cruise grounding its entire fleet in November 2023. Patrick Morrisey, VP of corporate communications at GM, told TechCrunch that the reduction in spending is still in effect, despite today\u2019s capital infusion.\n\u201cThe total reduction in spending announced earlier is based on the fact that Cruise\u2019s total operating costs are lower in 2024 versus 2023 (operations paused for several months, smaller fleet, fewer cities, etc.\u2026\u201d Morrisey said via email, noting that Cruise still needs money to advance its technology. Just not as much.\nIn total, Cruise has already raised over $15 billion, per Crunchbase data. GM has spent, and lost, over $8 billion since acquiring Cruise in 2016, with $3.48 billion lost in 2023 alone. But the fresh funds suggest that GM is not yet ready to give up on its investment.\nCruise has struggled since commercializing its fully autonomous, driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco and Austin. Shortly after pulling out the driver, incidents of vehicles bricking and blocking traffic, public transit and first responders began to surface on social media. In October, a Cruise robotaxi ran over and dragged a pedestrian 20 feet in San Francisco. The pedestrian had initially been hit by a human-driven car and landed in the path of a Cruise robotaxi. Federal and state regulators accused Cruise employees of providing incomplete information in their reporting, showing video only of the vehicle hard braking and not dragging the pedestrian as the car attempted a pullover maneuver.\nWhen that additional information came to light, the California Department of Motor Vehicles immediately suspended the company\u2019s permits to operate self-driving vehicles on public roads, and those still have not been reinstated.\nThe DMV has confirmed to TechCrunch that Cruise is in talks to reinstate its permits in the state. In other states where AV companies don\u2019t need to acquire permits, Cruise is already making a comeback.\nCruise has launched small fleets in Phoenix, Dallas and now Houston that will operate with a human safety driver behind the wheel. The company aims to validate its technology and move slowly in order to win back public trust.\n\ntitle4:\nComputing firm to raise $211 million\ndescription4:\nwatch now\nShares of Raspberry Pi surged Tuesday, rallying by more than 38%, as the British computing startup sought to raise some \u00a3166 million ($211.2 million) from its initial public offering. Shares of Raspberry Pi begun \"conditional dealing\" on Tuesday with a full open trade due to begin on Friday. Shares rose to 388 pence by the close after the firm, which makes tiny single-board computers, priced its shares at 280 pence apiece. The listing is seen as a rare win for London's main stock exchange which has struggled to attract technology listings. Based on the initial pricing of its shares, the company was valued at around \u00a3541.6 million.\nThe Raspberry Pi offering comprises 45.9 million ordinary shares sold by the company's existing majority shareholder, Raspberry Pi Mid Co Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It also includes 2.13 million ordinary shares sold by other shareholders, along with 11.23 million freshly issued shares. If there is more demand, a so-called overallotement option will allow the Raspberry Pi Foundation to issue another 4.6 million shares. If the overallotment option is exercised, the final offer size will be \u00a3178.9 million. Raspberry CEO Eben Upton established the company in 2012 to make computing more accessible to young people. Its single board computers can be used to power a whole range of uses. While it initially gained traction with hobbyists, the company says that 72% of its unit sales target the industrial market, where it is used, for example, in factories.\nwatch now\"\n\nResponse:",
