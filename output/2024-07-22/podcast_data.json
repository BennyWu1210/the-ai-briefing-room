Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The outfit\u2019s venture backers include Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital, among others.\nBelow is the email that Rappaport sent to employees:\n\ntitle1:\nCohere raises $500M to beat back generative AI rivals\ndescription1:\nCohere, a generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, has raised $500 million in new cash from investors including Cisco, AMD and Fujitsu.\nThe round, which also had participation from Canadian pension investment manager PSP Investments and Canada\u2019s export credit agency EDC, values Toronto-based Cohere at $5.5 billion, according to Bloomberg. That\u2019s more than double the startup\u2019s valuation from June 2023, when it secured $270 million from Inovia Capital and others, and brings Cohere\u2019s total raised to $970 million.\nJosh Gartner, head of communications at Cohere, told TechCrunch that the financing sets Cohere up for \u201caccelerated growth.\u201d \u201c[W]e continue to significantly expand our technical teams to build the next generations of accurate, data privacy-focused enterprise AI,\u201d Gartner said in a statement. \u201cCohere is laser-focused on leading the AI industry beyond esoteric benchmarks to deliver real-world benefits in the daily workflows of global businesses across regions and languages.\u201d\nCohere was seeking to nab between $500 million and $1 billion for its next round of fundraising, and was in talks with Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures to raise the money, according to Reuters. Both Nvidia and Salesforce ended up contributing, Gartner confirmed in an email to TechCrunch.\nAiden Gomez launched Cohere in 2019 along with Nick Frosst and Ivan Zhang, with whom Gomez had done research at FOR.ai, a sort of progenitor to Cohere. Gomez is one of the co-authors of a 2017 technical paper, \u201cAttention Is All You Need,\u201d that laid the foundation for many of the most capable generative AI models today, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion.\nUnlike OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral and many of its generative AI startup rivals, Cohere doesn\u2019t have a big consumer focus. Instead, the company customizes its AI models, which perform tasks such as summarizing documents, writing website copy and powering chatbots, for companies like Oracle, LivePerson and Notion.\nCohere\u2019s AI platform is cloud agnostic, able to be deployed inside public clouds (e.g. Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services), a customer\u2019s existing cloud, virtual private clouds or onsite. The startup takes a hands-on approach, working with customers to create tailored models based on their proprietary data.\nCohere also runs a nonprofit research lab, Cohere for AI, and releases open models like multilingual models for understanding and analyzing text. Its latest flagship model, Command R+, is designed to deliver many of the capabilities of more expensive models (e.g. GPT-4o) while costing less.\nCohere\u2019s has proven to be a winning strategy, even as both OpenAI and Anthropic ramp up their respective enterprise sales efforts. At the end of March, Cohere was generating $35 million in annualized revenue with a customer base of hundreds of companies, up from around $13 million at the end of 2023, according to Bloomberg.\nGenerative AI at Cohere\u2019s scale is a costly endeavor \u2014 particularly as the company looks to train more sophisticated systems. The new tranche will surely help, as will Cohere\u2019s ongoing partnership with Google Cloud, wherein Google provides cloud infrastructure to train and run Cohere\u2019s models. Cohere also has close ties to Oracle, which is an investor as well as a customer; the startup\u2019s AI is built into many of Oracle\u2019s software products, including Oracle NetSuite.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Cohere is planning to double its 250-employee headcount this year.\n\ntitle2:\n17-year-old Eric Zhu's startup was built in a high school bathroom - now it's raised $2.3M and is emerging from stealth\ndescription2:\nEric Zhu started building Aviato, an analytical platform for private market data, in a very atypical place for an entrepreneur: the bathroom in his Carmel, Indiana, high school. Now the 17-year-old\u2019s startup is emerging from stealth with $2.3 million in venture funding.\nAviato tracks funding rounds and headcount, similar to competitors like Crunchbase and PitchBook, as well as data points like company credit card revenue data, employee vesting schedules, and where top engineers are currently working, in addition to other metrics. If that sounds a little like what SignalFire built for its internal database, that\u2019s intentional. Zhu said Aviato\u2019s goal is to build a platform that resembles what SignalFire has built internally; in fact, he said that his startup has worked closely with the firm\u2019s founder, Walter Kortschak, to build out its product.\nZhu told TechCrunch that he credits his early interest in venture capital and startups from being in the right place at the right time during the boring days of the pandemic, learning about the space from Discord group chats he joined in 2020, when he was 13, that included people like Sam Altman.\nThis interest led him to launch a company called Esocial, a digital platform for schools, in 2021; it was acquired 10 months later. Shortly after, he joined Bachmanity Capital, which backs early-stage companies that have strong government application potential. Building the fund is when he got the idea for Aviato. He realized that while data startups like PitchBook and Crunchbase were good at tracking data, they were lacking that analytical layer that he thought was missing to make these platforms really useful.\n\u201cAviato came from the idea that private market data has been historically super unstructured,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why funds are spending tens of millions of dollars to make their internal databases.\u201d\nTo build Aviato, a nod to HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d TV show, Zhu took meetings from his high school bathroom. He\u2019d set up in the stall with a green screen, a ring light and an excuse to be out of class. Zhu ended up getting kicked out of school for doing so, but not before he was able to land customers like NEA, Republic Capital and 8VC.\nAviato\u2019s $2.3 million seed funding came from 8VC, Soma Capital and SoftBank, among others. Eric Bahn, a co-founder and general partner at Hustle Fund, made a personal investment in the startup a few years ago. Bahn told TechCrunch that he took a meeting with Zhu after the teenager sent him one of the better cold emails Bahn had ever received. Bahn described that Zoom call as bizarre.\n\u201cHe had his braces on,\u201d Bahn recalled about Zhu, who was 14 years old at the time. \u201cHe clearly looked quite young, but he was oddly mature. The really strange part is he was clearly in the bathroom stall as a high school freshman, and I was like, \u2018Where the f*** are you right now?\u2019 I literally said that. He said, \u2018I pretended that I had diarrhea, so I think I have like 30 minutes to chat with you.\u2019\u201d\nBahn said he made a $3,000 investment at the time and joked that he probably was flushing it down the figurative, and literal, toilet. But now, three years later, he feels differently as Zhu has matured and the product has come to fruition.\n\u201cI started to play with the product myself; it\u2019s pretty elegantly made,\u201d Bahn said. \u201cHe\u2019s already proven to me one thing: the quality of people he\u2019s hired. His more executive team, they are very serious builders.\u201d\nLast fall, the startup brought on David Razavi, the former CTO of LowerMyBills and former product lead at LendingTree, as a co-founder and COO. Harrison Kessel rounds out the founding team and serves as CTO. Kessel was the third employee at Sequoia-backed Zeet, where he built out the developer-focused data application platform\u2019s data infrastructure.\nZhu has now moved to San Francisco and is working to finish his high school degree online. He said that his parents are still a little confused about what he is doing, and his mom may still want him to be a doctor, but Zhu doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about that.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a product, and a lot of people like it,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOur customer base is venture funds, private equity funds and more. I want to sell to every single person that works with private markets in general. We will be able to replace PitchBook.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nCrowdStrike shares tumble as fallout from global tech outage continues\ndescription3:\nGeorge Kurtz, president CEO and Co-Founder at CrowdStrike speaks at the WSJTECH live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S. October 21, 2019.\nCrowdStrike shares slipped 13% during Monday's trading session, as the cybersecurity software company continued to help clients across industries recover from an outage that took millions of Microsoft Windows devices offline last week.\nEarly on Friday, the company issued a defective update to its Falcon vulnerability-protection software that caused PCs, computer servers in data centers and display screens to crash, resulting in grounded flights and canceled medical appointments. The incident ensnared 8.5 million Windows devices, less than 1% of the global total, Microsoft said.\nIT staffers quickly worked to fix computers. Meanwhile, hackers sought to take advantage of the confusion by setting up malicious websites that appeared to offer software updates. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz addressed the situation on air with CNBC's Jim Cramer.\nCrowdStrike shares fell 11% on Friday. But then, over the weekend, people shared photos on social media of Windows devices displaying the so-called \"blue screen of death,\" a sign of computers in need of attention from administrators. CrowdStrike said on Sunday that it was testing a method that would fix affected machines more quickly.\nGuggenheim Securities downgraded its rating on CrowdStrike shares to neutral from buy on Sunday. Analysts led by John DiFucci said the stock was still trading at \"the highest multiple of recurring revenue across our entire software coverage.\"\nIt might take time for CrowdStrike to repair its image, and the fallout will probably hurt signings, the analysts wrote. Signings are an early estimate of contract value from new and existing customers that can give investors a sense of a company's potential for revenue generation.\n\"We still have the utmost respect for the leadership team at CrowdStrike and believe that the company will eventually become even stronger as a result of this incident, and if investors have a multi-year horizon, they can ride it out,\" they wrote. \"However, we find it difficult to tell investors that they need to buy CRWD right now.\"\nGoldman Sachs maintained their buy rating on CrowdStrike shares in a note issued early Monday. But analysts at the investment bank said they expected CrowdStrike's deals to take longer to close between the time of the outage and July 31 \u2014 the end date of the software company's fiscal second quarter.\n\"Our recent conversations reaffirm our view that there will likely be minimal share shifts in endpoint post this event \u2014 although we recognize that additional details in the postmortem will further inform this view,\" analysts led by Gabriela Borges wrote.\nThey pointed to a 2010 McAfee outage that caused computer crashes to give a sense of what came before last week's events.\n\"The revenue impact due to deferrals was about $6 million of deferred revenue not recognized from the balance sheet, and revenue was also negatively impacted by another approximately $14 million,\" then-CEO Dave DeWalt told analysts in July of that year on a conference call. Kurtz was McAfee's chief technology officer at the time.\nLess than one month after the McAfee earnings call, Intel announced its intent to buy the antivirus company for $7.7 billion.\n\"This is an evolving situation,\" CrowdStrike said in a regulatory filing on Monday. \"We continue to evaluate the impact of the event on our business and operations.\"\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle's Jigsaw open sources Altitude to help online platforms weed out extremist content\ndescription4:\nGoogle\u2019s incubator subsidiary Jigsaw has open sourced a counterterrorism tool designed to help smaller companies address extremist content shared through their online platforms.\nWhile most of the big tech companies, including Meta, X and Google itself, are well-versed in moderating content to weed out illegal or toxic content, the resources required to do this are beyond the means of many smaller digital players. This is particularly problematic at a time when legislation such as Europe\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) and terrorism-specific content rules have placed companies under increasing pressure to remove illicit content post-haste.\nFormerly known as Google Ideas ahead of a rebrand in 2016, Jigsaw is focused on developing and experimenting new products that tackle societal issues such as disinformation, censorship and the spread of toxicity and extremist content online. Last November, Jigsaw announced a new online content moderation tool called Altitude, which helps moderators verify whether content on their platforms matches that which has been flagged on third-party databases, rather than having to check against each source individually.\nAltitude in action. Image Credits: Jigsaw\nAltitude was developed in partnership with Tech Against Terrorism, an initiative launched in 2017 by the United Nations\u2019 Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED). Tech Against Terrorism\u2019s remit is to support the tech industry in developing more effective tools to tackle terrorists\u2019 use of the internet to spread harmful content. The tool was also developed in partnership with industry-led outfit Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), which counts most of the big tech companies as members.\nNine months on, and Jigsaw is now formally handing Altitude over to Tech Against Terrorism, which will continue its development and maintenance. The code is also now available on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning that companies are able to self-host the tool, and third-parties are able to inspect the code.\nHow Altitude works\nAltitude leans on \u201ctrusted\u201d data sources provided by the likes of GIFCT, whose members pool their proprietary information for the purpose of powering automated content moderation tools (such as Altitude), as well as Tech Against Terrorism\u2019s own Terrorist Content Analytics Platform, a database of real-time, verified terrorist content. Trusted sources identify and flag this type of content using their own methods.\nBy funneling into these databases, Altitude consolidates what it calls \u201cterrorist and violent extremist content\u201d (TVEC) into a single view, with moderators able to view, review and remove content swiftly and adhere to their obligations under whatever jurisdiction they operate within. It\u2019s worth noting that no content is automatically removed, it\u2019s all about flagging and providing alerts to potential extremist content for humans to assess.\nAltitude in action. Image Credits: Altitude\nNeither Jigsaw nor Tech Against Terrorism has revealed any of the platforms that have used Altitude through its initial testing period, however the kinds of applications that are most likely to use it include messaging apps, URL-shortening services, video-hosting sites, online forums, social networks and pastebins.\nJigsaw wrote in a blog post Monday:\nOver the course of a year, Jigsaw conducted interviews with founders, trust and safety leaders, and TVEC content reviewers at eleven platforms, ranging in size. Platforms included image-sharing platforms, social media sites, url shortening services and file and text storage sites. We found that platforms existed along a scale of resourcing and preparedness to manage TVEC, and that that level of preparedness was not neatly related to the size of their organization or user base. Even relatively mature services still sometimes lacked signals to proactively identify harms on their platform.
