Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

It is now the second-most valuable public company, behind Microsoft.\nNvidia also hit a $3 trillion market cap milestone on Wednesday after shares rose over 5%. At market close, Nvidia had a market value of $3.019 trillion, versus Apple's, which stood at $2.99 trillion. Microsoft is the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.15 trillion, as of Wednesday.\nNvidia shares have risen more than 24% since the company reported first-quarter earnings in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, which are attracting billions of dollars in spending from big cloud vendors.\nInvestors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia's huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, revenue in its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, about 86% of the company's overall sales.\nMeanwhile, Apple shares are up only about 5% this year, as the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.\nApple was the first company to reach a $1 trillion and $2 trillion market cap. It long held the title of most valuable U.S. company but was passed by Microsoft earlier this year. Microsoft has also benefited from investor demand for AI infrastructure.\nNvidia has been more volatile as a stock than Apple. Founded in 1991, the company was primarily targeting gaming, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently, it sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.\nNvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising more than 3,290% over the past five years. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split in May.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle acquires Cameyo to integrate Windows app virtualization into ChromeOS\ndescription1:\nGoogle is acquiring software virtualization company Cameyo in a push to deeply integrate virtualized Windows app support into ChromeOS. Google was already working closely with Cameyo, and now it\u2019s bringing this key virtualization expertise and technology in-house.\nGoogle partnered with Cameyo last year to deliver a virtual application experience for legacy Windows desktop apps that was integrated into ChromeOS. This included local file system integration, virtual apps as progressive web apps, and even enhanced clipboard support.\nCameyo\u2019s Virtual App Delivery (VAD) integration into ChromeOS is designed for businesses that are looking to move away from Windows or even add some ChromeOS devices into the mix. It allows businesses to continue running virtualized Windows apps on ChromeOS without exposing a full version of Windows so that apps just feel like they\u2019re running on ChromeOS side by side with Chrome and other web apps.\n\u201cThis acquisition will lead to even deeper integration of these virtualized apps into ChromeOS,\u201d says Cameyo co-founder and CMO Robb Henshaw in a statement to The Verge. \u201cFurther integrations will improve not only the end user experience, but also make it even simpler for IT admins to deploy and push those apps out to their users.\u201d\nAs more and more apps move to the cloud and web-based technologies, Google has a big opportunity to entice more businesses to consider ChromeOS over Windows \u2014 especially with improved virtualized app support from Cameyo.\n\ntitle2:\nIntel CEO talks of regaining market share\ndescription2:\nIntel wants to regain its position as the world's leading chipmaker, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, after being overtaken by rivals TSMC and Samsung in recent years.\n\"We want to build everybody's chips, everybody's AI chips. We want them to be built leveraging the U.S. factories,\" Gelsinger told CNBC on the sidelines of the Computex tech conference in Taipei on Tuesday.\nIntel seeks to boost its struggling foundry business, which posted a wider operating loss of $7 billion in 2023 versus the prior year. It is currently not in the top six foundries by revenue, according to a Counterpoint Research report on May 22.\nThe company was the world's largest chipmaker until 2017 when Samsung Electronics surpassed it in revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reportedly overtook Samsung in 2023 to become the world's largest foundry by revenue.\n\"The first piece is to get back to leadership, because a lot of the losses are associated with having uncompetitive process technology,\" said Gelsinger.\nAs much as $8.5 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funding from the Biden administration, with another potential $11 billion in offing, is expected to help Intel advance its semiconductor manufacturing and research and development.\n\"The capital is critical. And what we said is that we have to have economic competitiveness if we're going to build these factories in the U.S. and that's what the chips Act has done. It's created a level playing field if I were building a factory in Asia versus U.S.,\" Gelsinger said.\nIntel, which designs chips as well, also wants to catch up with Nvidia and AMD after having largely been on the sidelines of the AI frenzy which saw tech giants Meta, Microsoft and Google buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible.\nDuring Computex tech conference in Taipei on Tuesday, Gelsinger unveiled the new Xeon 6 processor for data centers with improved performance and power-efficiency compared to its predecessor.\n\ntitle3:\nWhat to expect from Apple's AI-powered iOS 18 at WWDC 2024\ndescription3:\nApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference next week promises to be a pivotal moment in the iPhone maker\u2019s history. Though the Vision Pro debuted at last year\u2019s event, don\u2019t expect hardware to be the main attraction at WWDC 2024, which kicks off Monday at 10 a.m. PT.\nWWDC is for developers, and much of the focus will be on iOS 18. The Cupertino tech giant will showcase how it\u2019s chosen to integrate AI technology into its devices and software, including through a historic partnership with OpenAI. As the big event nears, all sorts of leaks have emerged about what iOS 18 and its rumored AI-powered apps and features have in store.\nAmong the changes, Apple is said to be powering some of its new AI features with its Ajax LLM. Other reports indicate that Apple plans to process data from AI in a way that even employees won\u2019t be able to access, which would help Apple continue to deliver on its promise of data privacy for its users.\nBelow, we\u2019ll take a look at how Apple is said to be adding AI to its apps and services in the next big update for the iPhone, alongside other improvements and changes coming to iOS 18.\nSiri\u2019s AI-enabled future\nApple\u2019s digital assistant is prepared to get an AI revamp. The digital assistant will leverage Apple\u2019s own large language models and will allow Siri to control individual features inside applications. This will work without any necessary setup by developers or users, like App Intents or Siri Shortcuts currently require. Instead, users will be able to ask Siri to do things like delete an email or edit a photo.\nSome of Siri\u2019s upgraded AI capabilities won\u2019t be ready until next year. For example, the ability for Siri to handle tasks with multiple steps is likely delayed.\nA more advanced Siri will also come to Apple Watch for on-the-go use. You could use Siri on your Watch to play music on another device, one report said.\nSiri will receive more natural-sounding voices.\nSiri will be able to summarize notifications that include people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates and more.\nCould Siri\u2019s new look be hinted at in the animations below?\nGet ready for an action packed #WWDC24 next week! pic.twitter.com/8ttYkFJdQI \u2014 Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) June 3, 2024\nApple Photos\u2019 new look\nA new interface is being teased.\nPeople will have the ability to retouch photos with AI, perhaps challenging Google Photos in this area.\nA \u201cClean Up\u201d feature would, for instance, let you remove objects from your photos using generative AI technology, similar to Google\u2019s Magic Eraser.\nOne report noted that Apple made an internal-only application called Generative Playground that uses GenAI to create and edit images. It\u2019s unclear how this functionality will be presented to end users, though iMessage integration was spotted in the form of an app extension.\nSafari with more AI\nAI recaps of Safari web pages and news articles will be available through a new Intelligent Search feature. (Watch out, Arc?)\nNotes injected with AI\nUsers will be able to ask for AI recaps of Notes.\nGenAI will also help to transcribe audio in Notes.\nIn-app audio recording will be supported alongside audio transcription and AI summarization.\nMath Notes will help users create graphs and solve equations through AI by recognizing the text of mathematical equations and then helping you to solve them.\nNotes users may also have the option to auto-complete their mathematical equations when typing.\nProject Greymatter is the code name for a set of AI tools that are being integrated into core like Safari, Photos and Notes, Bloomberg reported.\nVoice Memos transcriptions\nReal-time transcription for voice memos is also coming.\niMessages\u2019 gets an AI makeover\nGenerative AI emojis will be supported, letting users create their own emojis with technology.\nAI recaps of missed texts will also be available.\nOverall deeper Siri integration is expected.\nTapbacks will get new icons.\nMessage effects for individual words will be supported in addition to effects for the message itself.\nMessages will offer suggested replies generated by Apple\u2019s on-device Ajax LLM to make texting back easier.\nRCS support is also expected to arrive this year to bring read recipes, typing indicators and high-quality video and images when texting with Android users via iMessage.\nCalendar refresh\nApple\u2019s LLM will be able to communicate with the Calendar app to check for events when composing responses to messages.\nMail with support for AI\nMail will also get suggested email replies generated by Ajax.\nNew Settings interface\nSettings will hopefully get less confusing with a revamped interface and updates that include better organization and improved search.\nA new Music widget will be available \u2014 possibly to feature larger artwork?\nImprovements to HomeKit for smart home integrations.\nNotifications\nAI recaps of missed notifications will be available.\nApple is working on something called \u201cEnhanced\u201d notifications.\nSpotlight\nSpotlight is expected to get faster, more reliable search.\niOS 18 will bring the ability to place app icons wherever you want, instead of having to align them to the grid without spaces in between them.\nUsers will also be able to change the color of app icons, perhaps as Apple\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s Material You.\nMaps with route creation\nMaps will support custom route creation in iOS 18, which lets users design their own routes for a trip.\nMusic with AI-powered playlists\nApple Music may take on Spotify with its own AI-powered auto-generated playlists.\nMore improvements\nOther apps with planned updates include Freeform, Xcode and Apple\u2019s productivity apps, like Keynote and Pages, which may get GenAI features.\nWe\u2019re launching an AI newsletter!

The two cities mark Zoox\u2019s fourth and fifth test cities, following Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle.\nThe news comes as federal regulators increase their scrutiny of self-driving car companies like Waymo and Zoox, both of which are under investigation over safety issues. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requested more information from Zoox to aid its probe into rear-end crash risks posed by unexpected braking.\nThat heightened scrutiny \u2014 fueled in part by a Cruise incident last year involving a pedestrian collision \u2014 might be part of the reason Zoox has been taking a slow and steady approach to testing and scaling.\nA Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company began mapping the cities this spring. Over the summer, Zoox will deploy its retrofitted Toyota Highlander test fleet with safety drivers behind the wheel \u201cin small areas near the business and entertainment districts.\u201d The company did not say how many test vehicles it would send to each city.\nZoox also didn\u2019t say when it aims to remove the safety driver or begin commercial operations in Austin or Miami. Rather, the company is focused on using the different urban environments to fine-tune its autonomous system. For example, Austin has horizontal traffic lights, traffic lights hanging on wires, railway crossings and epic thunderstorms. Miami\u2019s traffic lights are suspended diagonally across intersections and, apparently, the city is plagued with impatient drivers afflicted by road rage.\nZoox\u2019s testing protocol is twofold: The company identifies specific pre-planned routes that offer challenging driving features and scenarios, while also randomly testing certain point-to-point routes within a defined geofence.\n\u201cWe always start with a focused testing area, expanding methodically as our AI gets more familiar with the unique conditions in each city,\u201d reads the blog post.\nThe plans to test in Austin and Miami come as Zoox gears up for its first commercial launch. Zoox has a permit to test its vehicles without a safety driver in parts of San Francisco and Foster City, and is targeting that market as one of its first launch cities alongside Las Vegas.\nZoox did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for a timeline for commercial deployment or to provide definitions of the geofenced areas.\nZoox has become associated with images of its purpose-built robotaxi, that cute, breadbox-shaped vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals and side doors that slide open to admit passengers. The company won\u2019t be testing those vehicles on public roads in Austin or Miami, just yet.\nZoox has begun limited testing of the fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Las Vegas and Foster City and plans to start offering rides to passengers this year. In February, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) granted Zoox its driverless AV pilot permit, which allows the company to carry members of the public for free within the bounds of its approved Foster City domain. Zoox has not confirmed if it has begun doing that.\nZoox\u2019s expansion news comes as the robotaxi space gets a second wind. Or maybe it\u2019s a third wind. GM\u2019s Cruise has also recently announced plans to test its robotaxis in Dallas and Phoenix. Alphabet\u2019s Waymo earlier this year began offering driverless rides to employees in Austin in preparation for a planned commercial launch this year, and the company also recently announced plans to begin robotaxi testing in Atlanta.\"\n\nResponse:",
