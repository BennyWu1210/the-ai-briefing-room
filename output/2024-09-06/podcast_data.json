Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent.

This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee.

Leonardo Munoz | View Press | Getty Images\nA month after losing a landmark antitrust case brought by the Department of Justice, Google is headed back to court to face off for a second time against federal prosecutors. In August, a judge ruled that Google has held a monopoly in internet search, marking the biggest antitrust ruling in the tech industry since the case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. This time, Google is defending itself against claims that its advertising business has acted as a monopoly that's led to higher ad prices for customers. The trial begins in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday and will likely last for at least several weeks. It represents the first tech antitrust trial from a case brought by the Biden administration. The department's earlier lawsuit was first filed in October 2020, when Donald Trump was in the White House. While U.S. officials have spent the past several years going after Big Tech, only Google has so far has ended up in federal court. The DOJ sued Apple in March, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its \"astronomical valuation\" at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers. In late 2020, the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust suit against Facebook (now Meta ), claiming the company had built a monopoly through acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Earlier this year, Meta asked a court to dismiss the suit. In 2023, the FTC and 17 states sued Amazon for allegedly wielding its \"monopoly power\" to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, undermining competition. For Google, the focus turns to its ad tools, which are part of the company's $200 billion digital ad business. The government claims Google is in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit anticompetitive behavior. The DOJ will argue that Google locked in publishers and advertisers to its products and that websites had to develop workarounds in response. A coalition of states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee, joined the case.\nwatch now\nGoogle's ad business has drawn numerous critics over the years because the platform operates on multiple sides of the market \u2014 buying, selling and an ad exchange \u2014 giving the company unique insights and potential leverage. In its initial lawsuit, the DOJ cited internal communication from a Google ad executive, who said owning multiple sides of the ad-selling process is like \"if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE,\" referring to the New York Stock Exchange. At stake is how Google is allowed to operate its portfolio of ad products. The DOJ, if successful, seeks the divestiture of, at minimum, the Google Ad Manager suite (GAM), the marketplace that gives brands the ability to create and manage ad units and track ad campaigns and lets publishers sell ad inventory. That's different from Google's flagship platform \u2014 Google Ads \u2014 which is primarily for businesses looking to advertise their products or services across search, websites, YouTube and other partner sites. In the most recent quarter, Google parent Alphabet reported ad revenue of $64.6 billion, accounting for over three-quarters of total sales. Of that amount, $48.5 billion came from search and other businesses like Gmail and Maps, and $8.7 billion came from YouTube. The GAM suite is part of the Google Network business, which generated $7.4 billion in second-quarter revenue, or about 11% of total ad sales. In addition to a potential partial breakup, Google could see a flood of litigation from advertisers seeking monetary rewards if the DOJ is successful. Bernstein analysts said Google could face up to $100 billion in such lawsuits. In the first antitrust case, the court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies. Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the DOJ, which argued that Google has kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance. \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote. Google now awaits its punishment for that case. The DOJ is asking for an extended time frame, until February, to offer remedies, followed by a hearing in April. Google says the DOJ should have already done its homework and should be prepared to offer its proposal in October.\nWhat each side will argue\nIn the second case, the DOJ plans to show that Google has cobbled together unrivaled power through the acquisitions of companies like DoubleClick in 2008, and by building services that let ad buyers target users across the internet. The company's M&A strategy \"set the stage for Google's later exclusionary conduct across the ad tech industry,\" the Justice Department alleges. The agency claims Google controls 91% of the market for ad servers, the space used by publishers to sell ads, and takes advantage of its power by unfairly raising ad prices. The DOJ plans to call YouTube CEO Neal Mohan in for live testimony. Mohan, was previously vice president at DoubleClick before the acquisition. After being rolled into Google's ad tech stack, DoubleClick's technology allowed Google to require publishers, in some instances, to use all of its tools to gain access to any of them, meaning they couldn't use rival services for parts of the online ad-buying process, the agency alleges. \"Website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more, than they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools that would ultimately result in higher quality and lower cost transactions for market participants,\" the DOJ says. Some publishers have been forced to turn to alternative models like subscriptions to fund their operations, the government says, while others have gone out of business.\nwatch now\nGoogle has long fought back against claims that it dominates online ads, pointing to the market share of competitors including Meta. It will argue that buyers and sellers have many options especially as the online ad market has evolved. Google will also argue that the DOJ's pursuits would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow. The company says that its ad tools adapt to handle the billions of ad auctions taking place on the internet each day, and that the DOJ doesn't have an accurate picture of the ad space. Google will also tell the court that it's always offered competitive rates for customers, who often mix and match advertising platforms. As it relates to deal-making, Google will claim that DoubleClick and AdMeld weren't killer acquisitions at the time and that regulators signed off on them. In trying to prove its case, the DOJ has listed potential testimony from Jerry Dischler, formerly vice president of Google's ad platform who currently leads the company's cloud applications. It's also noted the potential to call on several Google product managers. Also on the DOJ's list is Google AI executive Sissie Hsiao, who was formerly a director of global display, video and mobile app advertising, and Scott Sheffer, who is listed as vice president of Google partnerships. The government plans to include evidence from internal Google communications, testimony from publishers, advertisers and companies that tried to compete with Google as well as experts and professors from Stanford and Harvard, filings show. Google also noted it may call on Nitish Korula, engineering director for Google assistant who was formerly senior technical advisor to search head Prabhakar Raghavan. It also requested testimony from Simon Whitcombe, a vice president at Meta, and suggested depositions from executives at BuzzFeed and The New York Times.\nThough the DOJ and Google submitted a list of executives named for potential testimony or deposition, those individuals won't necessarily be called. Google declined to comment for this article.

Prosecutors have until the end of the year to submit their proposals, which could take aim at Google\u2019s billion-dollar payments to Apple in exchange for priority placement, or potentially order Google to sell off parts of its business.\nA lot can change in one year, however, especially given the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Republican and Democratic donors are both reportedly asking the candidates to shake up America\u2019s tough regulatory environment. The outcome of Google Search\u2019s antitrust case could be on the negotiating table in those discussions.\n\ntitle3:\nRoblox introduces new earning opportunities for creators, teases generative AI project\ndescription3:\nAt the annual Roblox Developers Conference, the company announced on Friday a series of changes coming to the platform in the next few months and years. Most notably, Roblox is adding more ways for creators to earn money through their experiences, and the company is unveiling a project that will power generative AI creation on the platform.\nThe company is introducing a new program that will give creators a higher share of revenue for their paid experiences on the desktop. Creators will now receive 50% of the revenue for paid experiences that cost $9.99, 60% for experiences that cost $29.99 and 70% for experiences that cost $49.99. The change marks a significant increase in revenue sharing, as creators currently earn about 25% of the revenue for their paid experiences.\nRoblox chief product officer Manuel Bronstein told TechCrunch in an interview that the company believes this change will encourage more traditional game developers to bring their games to the platform.\nImage Credits: Roblox\nThe company also announced that it\u2019s partnering with Shopify to allow creators to sell physical merchandise directly within their experiences. Roblox plans to pilot this integration later this year with select creators, brands and e-commerce partners.\nTo further support creators, Roblox is going to roll out a \u201cPrice Optimization\u201d tool that will run tests to help developers identify the best price for in-experience purchases. In some cases, the tool may suggest that developers lower the price of an item to get more sales, benefiting both the developer and players.\nIn the same vein, the company is going to start experimenting with regional pricing recommendations to allow developers to tailor their prices to local markets.\nPowering generative AI creation\nIn terms of AI, Roblox announced that it\u2019s working on a 3D foundational model that will power generative creation on its platform. The model will be open source and multimodal and allow creators to generate 3D content using text, video and prompts.\n\u201cA creator could say I want to create a world that is in the Scottish Highlands with castles and a stormy day, with a dragon background, and I want all of this in a steampunk steam style. And then the output will be the full scene creation,\u201d Bronstein said.\nHe noted that generative AI is currently focused on pictures and videos, not 3D creation. But, in Roblox, you need 3D objects, so if you see a tree, it needs to behave like a tree and also be visible from all sides.\nBronstein noted that Roblox isn\u2019t trying to replace the creative process but instead focuses on enabling more people to develop and create games. For instance, you may be a great developer but struggle with the artistic requirements for game creation. The 3D foundational model aims to make it easier for anybody to get started on the platform, while also helping current teams speed up the process of game development.\nPlus, just because you get an output, doesn\u2019t mean that you will implement it right away. Developers will likely fine-tune and modify the AI-generated content, Bronstein said.\nImage Credits: Roblox\nIn addition, Roblox revealed that it\u2019s rolling out a new technology called \u201cHarmony\u201d that will help developers automatically optimize their experiences for different devices and network conditions.\nMaking Roblox more social\nWhile Roblox already has social features that allow users to interact with each other, the company is introducing new ways for users to do so.\nFor starters, it\u2019s adding \u201cParty,\u201d which is a new way for a group of friends to move around Roblox together as a group in a private chat. If a user is under the age of 13, they can chat via text. If a user is older, they can use voice chat. Users in a Party can chat with each other even if they\u2019re playing different games, and if they all want to play the same game, they can send invites to each other.\nThe company is also introducing forums later this year to give users a dedicated space to share feedback, discuss gameplay and report any issues they encounter.\nImage Credits: Roblox\nTo make its platform a destination for people to discover new music, Roblox will roll out a new \u201cWhat\u2019s Playing\u201d and \u201cMusic Charts\u201d feature where people will be able to find trending songs from breakout artists. Roblox is also planning an integration with music distribution service DistroKid to give artists a way to upload and share their music on the platform.\nAll of the features announced today are part of Roblox\u2019s ambitious goal of having 10% of all gaming content revenue worldwide flow through its ecosystem. Although the company didn\u2019t provide a timeline for when it aims to reach this goal, Roblox believes the changes it is introducing will help it achieve the milestone.\n\ntitle4:\nAI craze getting funded by tech giants, distorting traditional VCs\ndescription4:\nAmazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky speaks with Anthropic CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei during AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023. Noah Berger | Getty Images\nAlmost three years into a largely dormant IPO cycle, venture capitalists are in a tough spot. The private market is dotted with richly valued artificial intelligence startups, including some that are described as generational companies. But venture firms in need of exits aren't going to get relief from AI anytime soon. That's because, unlike prior tech booms, VCs aren't at the center of this one. Rather, the biggest companies in the industry \u2014 Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet and Nvidia \u2014 have been pouring in billions of dollars to fuel the growth of capital-intensive companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI and CoreWeave. With some of the most well-capitalized companies on the planet flinging open their wallets to fund the generative AI craze, the normal pressures to go public don't apply. And even if they did, this batch of startups is nowhere near showing off the profitability metrics that public investors need to see before taking the plunge. Tech giants have more than money. They're also throwing in tangible benefits like cloud credits and business partnerships, packaging the types of incentives that VCs can't match. \"The AI startups we talk to are having no problems fundraising at robust valuations,\" Melissa Incera, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told CNBC. \"Many are still reporting having too much unsolicited investor interest at the moment.\" Add it all up and venture investors are maneuvering through a deep market distortion with no clear end in sight. U.S. VC exit value this year is on track to reach $98 billion, down 86% from 2021, according to an Aug. 29 report from PitchBook, while venture-backed IPOs are expected to be at their lowest since 2016. Traditional VCs are actively trying to play in AI, but they're mostly investing higher up the so-called stack, putting money into nascent startups building applications that require far less capital than the infrastructure businesses powering generative AI. So far in 2024, investors have pumped $26.8 billion into 498 generative AI deals, including from strategic investors, according to PitchBook. That continues a trend from 2023, when generative AI companies raised $25.9 billion for the full year, up more than 200% from 2022. According to Forge Global, which tracks private market transactions, AI as a percentage of total fundraising jumped from 12% in 2023 to 27% so far this year. The average round for AI companies is 140% bigger this year compared with last, the data shows, while for non-AI companies the increase is only 10%. Chip Hazard, co-founder of early-stage firm Flybridge Capital Partners, says that investing dollars are shifting \"up the stack\" and that \"enduring companies will be built at the application layer.\"\nwatch now\nThat's all going to take time to develop. In the meantime, startup investors continue to suffer from the fallout of the market turn that began in early 2022, when soaring inflation led the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates, pushing investors out of risky assets and into more conservative investments that finally offered yield. Tech stocks have since bounced back, driven by Nvidia, whose chips are used in training most of the AI models, and other megacap stocks like Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. The Nasdaq hit a record in July before selling off a bit of late. But IPOs and pricey acquisitions have been few and far between, leaving venture firms with minimal returns for their limited partners. \"Managers are having a difficult time raising additional funds without delivering LP returns, especially because more liquid, lower-risk investments now have attractive yields thanks to high interest rates,\" PitchBook wrote in its August report. The one pure AI company that appears close to going public is Cerebras, a chipmaker founded in 2016 that's backed by some traditional VCs including Benchmark and Foundation Capital. As a semiconductor company, Cerebras never reached the lofty valuations of the AI model developers and other infrastructure players, topping out at $4 billion in 2021, before the market's downward tilt. Cerebras said in late July that it had confidentially filed its initial public offering paperwork with the SEC. The company still hasn't filed its public prospectus. A Cerebras spokesperson declined to comment. When it comes to the foundational model companies, the astronomical valuations they quickly commanded put them in a very \"different league,\" outside of the realm of VCs, said Jeremiah Owyang, a partner at Blitzscaling Ventures. It's \"very challenging for VCs to be promising any exits right now, given the market conditions,\" Owyang said, adding that early-stage investors may not see returns for seven to 12 years on their newer bets. That's for their companies that ultimately succeed.\nElbowing into big rounds\nFirms like Menlo Ventures and Inovia Capital are taking another route in AI. In January, Menlo disclosed that it was raising a so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV) \u2014 called Menlo Inflection AI Partners \u2014 as part of a $750 million funding round in Anthropic in a deal that valued the company at more than $18 billion. Since Anthropic's launch in 2021, Amazon has been the company's principal backer as it tries to keep pace with Microsoft, which has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI and is reportedly part of an upcoming funding round that will value the ChatGPT creator at more than $100 billion. Menlo had previously invested in Anthropic in 2023 at a valuation of about $4.1 billion. To put in more money at a much higher price, Menlo had to go outside of its main $1.35 billion fund that closed last year. In raising an SPV, a venture firm typically asks for LPs to put money into a separate fund dedicated to a specific investment, rather than a portfolio of companies. Menlo filed to raise $500 million for the SPV. In July, rival startup Cohere, which focuses on generative AI for enterprises, announced a $500 million funding round from investors including AMD, Salesforce , Oracle and Nvidia that valued the company at $5.5 billion, more than doubling its valuation from last year. Cohere confirmed to CNBC that part of the financing, as well as some of its previous fundraising, came through an SPV. Inovia, based in Montreal, organized the latest SPV, and Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke was one of the participants. Representatives from Menlo and Inovia didn't respond to requests for comment.\nwatch now\nSome investment banks have also put together SPVs to allow multiple investors to pool capital into a hot company. JPMorgan Chase told CNBC that clients \"have been able to access several leading AI investments\" through the bank's Morgan Private Ventures unit. Still, for investors to get a return there has to be an IPO at some point, as the regulatory environment makes it virtually impossible for big tech companies to orchestrate significant acquisitions. And companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia can be plenty patient with their investments \u2014 they have a combined $280 billion in cash and marketable securities on their balance sheets.\nIPO pipeline will 'continue to build'\nThe other potential path for liquidity is the secondary market, which involves selling shares to another investor. Elon Musk's SpaceX, which reportedly valued itself at more than $200 billion in a recent employee tender offer, has enabled investor shares through secondary transactions. That may be what's eventually in store for some investors in xAI, Musk's 18-month-old AI startup, which is already valued at $24 billion after raising a $6 billion round in May. But SpaceX is an outlier. For the most part, secondary transactions are viewed as a way for founders and early investors to cash out a portion of their stock in a high-valued company, not a way for VCs to generate returns. For that they need IPOs.\nSpaceX's Polaris Dawn Falcon 9 rocket sits on Launch Complex 39A of NASA's Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 2024 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty Images\nMichael Harris, global head of capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange, told CNBC recently that the NYSE is in dialogue with \"a number of AI-focused companies\" and said that, \"as the industry evolves we'd expect that pipeline to continue to build.\" A select few AI companies have hit the public market this year. Astera Labs , which sells data center connectivity to cloud and AI infrastructure companies, debuted on the Nasdaq in March. The company is valued at about $6.5 billion, down from $9.5 billion after its first day of trading. Tempus AI, a health-care diagnostics company backed by Google, went public in June. The stock is up around 50% from its debut, valuing the company at $8.6 billion. The IPO floodgates never opened, though, and high-profile AI companies aren't even talking about going public. \"Unless there is a dramatic shift in market sentiment, I would be hard-pressed to see why these AI startups would put themselves in the public spotlight when they can keep growing privately at such favorable terms,\" said S&P's Incera. Going public \"would only amp up pressure to show returns or reduce spending, which for a lot of them is not a feasible ask at this point in the maturity curve,\" she said. Most venture investors are bullish on the potential for generative AI to eventually create big returns at the application layer. It's happened in every other notable tech cycle. Amazon, Google and Facebook were all web applications built on top of internet infrastructure. Uber , Airbnb and Snap were a few of the many valuable apps built on top of smartphone platforms. John-David Lovelock, an analyst at Gartner and a 35-year veteran of the IT industry, sees a big opportunity for generative AI in the enterprise. Yet, in 2024, only 1% of the trillion dollars spent on software will be from businesses spending on generative AI products, he said. \"There is money being spent on certain GenAI tools and the few applications that exist,\" Lovelock said. \"However, broad-scale rollout of GenAI within the broad enterprise software catalogue of products has not yet occurred.\"\"\n\nResponse:",
