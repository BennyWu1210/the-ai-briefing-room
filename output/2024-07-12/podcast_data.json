Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday July 15), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAT&T breach leaked call and text records from \u2018nearly all\u2019 wireless customers\ndescription0:\nAT&T revealed Friday morning that a cybersecurity attack had exposed call records and texts from \u201cnearly all\u201d of the carrier\u2019s cellular customers (including people on mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, that use AT&T\u2019s network, like Cricket, Boost Mobile, and Consumer Cellular). The breach contains data from between May 1st, 2022, and October 31st, 2022, in addition to records from a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers on January 2nd, 2023.\nAT&T spokesperson Alex Byers confirmed to The Verge the threat actor accessed the information through the company\u2019s account on a third-party cloud platform, Snowflake, similar to data breaches that have affected Ticketmaster and Santander Bank. AT&T first learned of the breach in April, but as reported by TechCrunch, an FBI spokesperson confirmed \u201cAT&T, the FBI and the Department of Justice agreed to delay notifying the public and customers on two occasions, citing \u2018potential risks to national security and/or public safety.\u2019\u201d\nThe stolen data includes which phone numbers customers interacted with, and Byers tells The Verge that the breach also includes \u201ccounts of those calls/texts and total call durations for specific days or months.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the information AT&T says is not included in the breach:\nThe downloaded data doesn\u2019t include the content of any calls or texts. It doesn\u2019t have the time stamps for the calls or texts. It also doesn\u2019t have any details such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information.\nWhile the data doesn\u2019t include customer names, there are often ways to find a name associated with a phone number using publicly available online tools.\nIn a blog post, AT&T said \u201cwe do not believe that the data is publicly available\u201d and that it has \u201ctaken steps to close off the illegal access point.\u201d The company is working with law enforcement to \u201carrest those involved\u201d and says one person has already been apprehended.\n\u201cWe will provide notice to current and former customers whose information was involved along with resources to help protect their information,\u201d AT&T writes. \u201cWe sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nMeta drops restrictions on Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts\ndescription1:\nFormer President Donald Trump will no longer be subject to extra severe penalties for content rule violations on his Facebook and Instagram accounts, Meta said on Friday.\nPreviously, Trump\u2019s account could be fully suspended for even a relatively small infraction that wouldn\u2019t lead to the same penalty for any other account. Now, with the Republican National Convention taking place next week, he\u2019ll be treated more like everyone else.\n\u201cIn assessing our responsibility to allow political expression, we believe that the American people should be able to hear from the nominees for President on the same basis,\u201d Meta\u2019s president of of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said in a company blog post. He added that the previous restrictions to Trump\u2019s accounts \u201cwere a response to extreme and extraordinary circumstances, and have not had to be deployed.\u201d\nNo politician has tested and contorted Meta\u2019s content policies like Trump. The company famously suspended him alongside other platforms after January 6th, 2021. At the beginning of 2023, he was allowed back on Facebook and Instagram but still placed in the penalty box, with Meta saying at the time that \u201cfurther violating content\u201d could get his account suspended again for up to two years.\n\ntitle2:\nSpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets are grounded after an in-flight failure\ndescription2:\nSpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket experienced an engine failure after it launched late Thursday night from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The mission, Starlink Group 9-3, was carrying Starlink satellites and failed to reignite its upper second stage after developing a leak. \u201cUpper stage restart to raise perigee resulted in an engine RUD for reasons currently unknown,\u201d Elon Musk said overnight, confirming that the engine experienced a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly.\u201d\nFalcon 9\u2019s second stage performed its first burn nominally, however a liquid oxygen leak developed on the second stage. After a planned relight of the upper stage engine to raise perigee \u2013 or the lowest point of orbit \u2013 the Merlin Vacuum engine experienced an anomaly and was unable to complete its second burn.\nThe company\u2019s statement says it will do a full investigation into the incident in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the company said on its website. The Falcon 9 has been grounded by the FAA pending the results of the investigation, reports CNBC.\nThe Falcon 9 has a lot riding on it \u2014 literally. It has been used for 52 percent of all orbital launches this year, according to Gunter Krebs's Orbital Launches tracker. (Thursday\u2019s launch was the 70th Falcon 9 launch in 2024; in all of 2023, the Falcon 9 was used for 96 launches.)\nThis was the first Falcon 9 failure since 2016 when a rocket exploded on the launch pad.\nAs a result of the failure, SpaceX said the Starlink satellites were deployed to \u201ca lower than intended orbit.\u201d\nOn Friday afternoon, the company said it had made contact with 10 satellites of the 20 that had been onboard but noted that the satellites are \u201cin an enormously high-drag environment with their perigee, or lowest point of their elliptical orbit.\u201d The maximum available thrust is \u201cunlikely to be enough to successfully raise the satellites,\u201d SpaceX said, meaning that they will reenter the atmosphere and \u201cfully demise.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon\u2019s AI shopping assistant rolls out to all users in the US\ndescription3:\nAmazon\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Rufus, is rolling out to all users in the US on Amazon\u2019s mobile app. You can pull up the shopping assistant by tapping the orange and blue icon in the right corner of the app\u2019s navigation bar, where Rufus can answer questions, draw comparisons between items, and give you updates on your order.\nAmazon first introduced Rufus in February but only made it available to a small group of users. Rufus uses Amazon\u2019s product listing details, reviews, and community Q&As, along with some information from the web, to inform its answers.\nImage: Amazon\nYou can ask the tool things directly related to a product, like \u201cIs this coffee maker easy to clean and maintain?\u201d as well as recommendations about the best outdoor speaker or even more general questions about the products you might need for a summer party. You can also ask Rufus for the status of a recent order.\nAfter updating my Amazon app, I got to try Rufus for myself. I navigated to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 I\u2019ve been eyeing and found the Rufus automatically surfaces some questions, like \u201cHow long does the battery last on a single charge?\u201d While it came up with the answer (40 hours), it failed to mention that this is only true with always-on display turned off (otherwise, it\u2019s around 30 hours).\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to get Rufus off the topic of shopping. Image: The Verge\nI also found that you can use it to answer questions completely unrelated to shopping, such as the US elections. When asking about the candidates\u2019 key issues, Rufus referred me to Amazon search results containing books on abortion rights and gun control. It also provided me with detailed information about President Joe Biden\u2019s stance on gun control when asked, while linking me to Amazon search results containing gun safety locks and biometric gun safes.\n\ntitle4:\nElon Musk's X deceives users and breaches online content rules, EU says\ndescription4:\nElon Musk, chief executive officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, speaks at the Milken Conference 2024 in Beverly Hills, California, May 6, 2024.\nThe European Commission on Friday accused Elon Musk's X of deceiving users and infringing digital content rules, putting the social media giant at risk of a hefty fine.\nThe commission, which is the European Union's executive arm, started an investigation last year to assess whether X is in breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 a piece of landscape legislation requiring Big Tech firms to better police the content on their platforms.\nThe body's preliminary view, published Friday, is that X has broken rules regarding dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers. So-called dark patterns are deceptive tactics designed to push people toward certain products and services.\nX's use of the blue checkmark for verified accounts does not correspond to industry practices, the commission said, as anyone can subscribe and obtain a verified status. It added that there was evidence of \"motivated malicious actors\" abusing the verified status to deceive users.\nThe commission also accused X of putting in place design features and barriers that hinder advertising transparency, and said it fails to allow researchers to access its public data, as is required by the DSA.\n\"In our view, X does not comply with the DSA in key transparency areas, by using dark patterns and thus misleading users, by failing to provide an adequate ad repository, and by blocking access to data for researchers,\" the European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said in Friday's statement.\n\"The DSA has transparency at its very core, and we are determined to ensure that all platforms, including X, comply with EU legislation.\"\nX did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nIn a post on X, Musk claimed that his company was offered an \"illegal secret deal\" by the commission that would have allowed it to avoid a fine \"if we quietly censored speech.\"\n\"The other platforms accepted that deal,\" Musk wrote, without providing evidence. \"X did not.\"\nIf the commission's views are confirmed, X could face a fine of up to 6% of its global annual revenue.\n\"X has now the right of defence \u2014 but if our view is confirmed we will impose fines & require significant changes,\" EU industry chief Thierry Breton said in a post on X.\nThe commission is also investigating TikTok, Alibaba's AliExpress and Meta over similar concerns.\nIt comes as the EU clamps down hard on tech giants like Google and Meta. In 2022 the commission introduced the Digital Services Act, with a key part of it focused on how digital companies target users with ads.\"\n\nResponse:",
