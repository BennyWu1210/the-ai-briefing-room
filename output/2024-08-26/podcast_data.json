Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday August 27), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple iPhone 16 event set for September 9 with 'Glowtime' invite\ndescription0:\nApple will unveil its iPhone 16 lineup on September 9, as the company has started sending out press invites on Monday for the upcoming event. The official announcement comes as previous reports had claimed that the event would take place on September 10.\nApple is using the tagline \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d for the event, which will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park at 10 a.m. PT/ 1 p.m. ET.\nAs always, rumors about what the event will include have surfaced over the past few weeks and months. For instance, reports have suggested that the iPhone 16 lineup will include larger screens on the Pro models and a new button dedicated to taking pictures. The idea behind the feature is to make it easier to capture content in landscape mode. All of the iPhone 16 models are expected to launch with the Action Button, which was previously only available on the iPhone 15 Pro line.\nPlus, it\u2019s possible that the event could include the unveiling of the Apple Watch Series 10, which is said to have a bigger screen and new chip to make the device more powerful. We may also see two versions of new AirPods.\nThe phones are also expected to support Apple\u2019s suite of AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, which were announced earlier this year.\nIn addition, it\u2019s likely that Apple will make iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11 and its other major operating system updates go live soon after the event.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk unexpectedly offers support for California's AI bill\ndescription1:\nElon Musk has come out in support of California\u2019s SB 1047, a bill that requires makers of very large AI models to create and document safeguards against those models causing serious harm.\n\u201cThis is a tough call and will make some people upset, but, all things considered, I think California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill,\u201d he wrote on X on Monday afternoon. \u201cFor over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk.\u201d\nMusk \u2014 whose own large AI model company, xAI, would be subject to SB 1047\u2019s requirements despite his pledge to leave California \u2014 has warned of the dangers of runaway AI in the past.\nMeanwhile, rival outfit OpenAI recently announced it opposes the bill, supporting an alternative bill instead.\n\ntitle2:\nPolaris Dawn will push the limits of SpaceX\u2019s human spaceflight program \u2014 here\u2019s how to watch it launch live\ndescription2:\nAfter a nearly three-year interlude, Jared Isaacman is returning to space. The billionaire entrepreneur first went to orbit as part of the Inspiration4 mission, which made history for having a crew comprised entirely of private citizens, not professional astronauts. But with this next mission, Polaris Dawn, he and mission partner SpaceX have set their sights even higher.\nLiterally: Polaris Dawn will fly farther than any mission using SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule to date, while also soaring through portions of the Van Allen radiation belt for the first time since the days of the Apollo missions.\nEven more daringly, when the four-person crew reaches around 700 kilometers (435 miles) above Earth, they\u2019ll attempt the first-ever commercial spacewalk \u2014 testing Dragon\u2019s ability to support extravehicular activities (EVAs) and giving SpaceX\u2019s EVA suits a spin for the very first time.\nThis isn\u2019t just a commercial trip sponsored by Isaacman; it\u2019s a joint mission with SpaceX, though the two have never publicly discussed cost.\nThis mission, as well as the two subsequent missions planned as part of the Polaris Dawn program, including one that will be the first crewed flight of Starship, \u201care meant to accelerate SpaceX\u2019s vision to make life multi planetary,\u201d Isaacman explained during a news conference earlier this month.\nThe suits are especially key to SpaceX\u2019s ambition to build the first permanent bases on the moon and Mars. The bases \u201cwill require millions of spacesuits,\u201d as the Polaris Dawn website says. The EVA suits that the Polaris Dawn crew will wear are evolved from the intravehicular activity suits astronauts wear inside Dragon capsules, but with a series of upgrades to make them suitable for the vacuum of space. That includes boots constructed from the same thermal material as Dragon\u2019s trunk, a heads-up display for use during the spacewalk and enhanced mobile joints.\nImage Credits: SpaceX\nThe Dragon spacecraft itself also has some upgrades. All four of the crew members will be wearing the EVA spacesuits even though only two crew members will actually exit the spacecraft because the interior will be depressurized prior to the walk. To enable this, SpaceX gave the spacecraft\u2019s life support systems a boost, including adding more oxygen to the system to feed it to all four suits, increased environmental monitoring and an entirely new nitrogen repressurization system.\nLike spacewalks conducted by NASA astronauts on the ISS, the Polaris Dawn crewmembers will connect their suits to umbilical cords for life support while they venture outside the craft. To support the crew members further, SpaceX added mobility aids, like handholds around the hatch, for when they venture out and back in. The entire operation, from venting the Dragon to repressurization, will take around two hours, with the two crew members actually outside the craft for 15-20 minutes.\nThe Polaris Dawn mission will also test Starlink laser-based communications in space, specifically the ability to connect to the Starlink satellite constellation directly from a spacecraft on orbit. The crew will further conduct a slew of science experiments and research with themselves as the subjects. For instance, they\u2019ll be blasting through the high-energy Van Allen belt, measuring the effects of radiation on human health.\n\u201cWe stand to learn quite a bit from [that environment] in terms of human health science and research,\u201d Isaacman said in that earlier news conference. \u201cIf we get to Mars someday, we\u2019d love to be able to come back and be healthy enough to tell people about it, so I think that it\u2019s worthwhile to get some exposure in that environment.\u201d\nIsaacman will be joined by three others: mission pilot Scott \u201cKidd\u201d Poteet, a retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; and two SpaceX employees, mission specialist Sarah Gillis, an engineer and astronaut trainer; and mission specialist Anna Menon, a medical officer who\u2019s also an engineer who runs the company\u2019s mission control for its flights.\nPolaris Dawn is due to take off on a Falcon 9 rocket on August 27 from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, with a four-hour launch window that opens at 3:38 a.m. EDT. The mission will last up to five days; at the farthest point, the spacecraft will propel the crew to 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from Earth. At the end of the mission, the crew will splash down off the coast of Florida.\nThe launch will be streamed live on X; follow along by clicking the link here.\nAs William Gerstenmaier, former NASA official and now SpaceX\u2019s VP of build flight reliability said during the press conference: \u201cIt\u2019s time to explore.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nApple will replace CFO Luca Maestri next year\ndescription3:\nApple announced today that Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri will step away from his executive role, effective January 1. Kevan Parekh, Apple\u2019s current VP of Financial Planning, will be promoted to CFO after 11 years at Apple.\nMaestri has been CFO at Apple since 2014, and he\u2019s now transitioning to a different role in the company, where he will report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Cook said in a press release that Maestri will continue leading the corporate services team, which encompasses information security and real estate.\nApple did not provide a reason for this shift, but said that it is \u201cpart of a planned succession.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI, Adobe and Microsoft support California bill requiring watermarks on AI content\ndescription4:\nOpenAI, Adobe and Microsoft have thrown their support behind a California bill requiring tech companies to label AI-generated content, according to letters from the companies viewed by TechCrunch. The bill is headed for a final vote in August.\nAB 3211 requires watermarks in the metadata of AI-generated photos, videos and audio clips. Lots of AI companies already do this, but most people don\u2019t read metadata. AB 3211 also requires large online platforms, like Instagram or X, to label AI-generated content in a way average viewers can understand.\nOpenAI, Adobe and Microsoft are part of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, which helped create C2PA metadata \u2014 a widely used standard for marking AI-generated content.\nA trade group representing Adobe, Microsoft and the nation\u2019s largest software makers previously opposed AB 3211 in April, calling the bill \u201cunworkable\u201d and \u201coverly burdensome\u201d in a letter to California lawmakers. However, amendments to the bill appear to have changed their minds.\"\n\nResponse:",
