Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday August 26), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nJustice Department sues RealPage over allegedly helping landlords collude to drive up rents\ndescription0:\nRealPage, which makes property management software, was sued Friday by the U.S. Justice Department and eight attorneys general for allegedly helping apartment and building managers around the country collude to drive up unit prices.\nThe Richardson, Texas-based outfit is accused of contracting with rival landlords to absorb info about their rates and lease terms to train RealPage\u2019s recommendation algorithms, and in the process discouraging competition among property owners who defer to the company\u2019s recommendations on pricing and other terms.\nIt\u2019s the DOJ\u2019s first big algorithmic collusion case and comes as rent in the U.S. skyrockets, climbing 33% since March 2020, according to Zillow.\nRealPage, which was acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo in 2021 for $10.2 billion, commands 80% of the market for commercial revenue management software for conventional multi-family housing rentals in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. The company denies any wrongdoing.\n\ntitle1:\nHalliburton shuts down systems after cyberattack\ndescription1:\nOil drilling and fracking giant Halliburton said it has shut down some of its internal systems following a cyberattack earlier this week.\nIn a brief statement filed with government regulators on Thursday, Halliburton said it became aware of unauthorized access to its systems on Wednesday and responded by \u201cproactively taking certain systems offline.\u201d The company said it is \u201cworking to identify any effects of the incident.\u201d\nHalliburton, which has close to 48,000 employees in dozens of countries per company filings, is one of the world\u2019s largest energy companies. The U.S. energy giant is widely associated with the massive oil spill caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, in which Halliburton later agreed to settle with the U.S. government for $1.1 billion.\nReuters first reported the cyberattack on Wednesday.\nU.S. Department of Energy spokesperson Jeremy Ortiz said in a statement that, \u201cthere are no indications that the incident is impacting energy services at this time and DOE is coordinating with interagency partners.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for companies to shut down their systems following a cyberattack, with the goal of preventing the intruders from having continued access to breached systems or gaining access to others. Several companies this year, including health giant Change Healthcare and automotive software maker CDK, shut down their systems following ransomware attacks.\nHalliburton spokesperson Victoria Ingalls declined to comment beyond the company\u2019s filing. When asked by TechCrunch, Ingalls declined to describe the nature of the security incident or say whether the company has received any communication from the intruders.\nThe spokesperson said \u201cany subsequent communications will be in the form of an 8-K,\u201d referring to public filings.\nOn Friday, TechCrunch identified a potential security issue that allows anyone to access internal Halliburton systems through its single-sign-on provider. When asked by TechCrunch if it was aware of the issue and if Halliburton provides the means to allow for the public reporting of security flaws, Halliburton spokesperson Ingalls declined to answer and reiterated the company\u2019s boilerplate statement.\nThe spokesperson declined to say which executive, if any, oversees responsibility for cybersecurity at Halliburton, when asked by TechCrunch.\nAccording to the company\u2019s latest full-year earnings release, Halliburton made $23 billion in revenue during 2023, up by 13% on the year prior. Halliburton chief executive Jeff Miller made $19 million in total executive compensation during 2023, the company\u2019s filings show.\nUpdated with comment from DOE spokesperson.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta and Spotify CEOs criticize AI regulation in the EU\ndescription2:\nMeta and Spotify are once again teaming up \u2014 this time, on the matter of open source (or to be precise, open-weight) AI which the companies claim are being hampered by regulations. In joint statements published to both companies\u2019 respective websites on Friday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek complain that EU privacy regulations around AI are holding back innovation. Meta, for instance, points out that it has been prevented from being able to train its AI models on public data across Facebook and Instagram because regulators haven\u2019t crafted legislation to address how this should be handled as of yet.\n\u201cIn the short term, delaying the use of data that is routinely used in other regions means the most powerful AI models won\u2019t reflect the collective knowledge, culture, and languages of Europe\u2014and Europeans won\u2019t get to use the latest AI products,\u201d Meta\u2019s blog post warns. It also stresses that Europeans won\u2019t be able to access the latest open source technology and instead will be left with AI \u201cbuilt for someone else.\u201d\nThe post additionally confirmed previous reports that Meta would withhold its next multimodel AI model from customers in the European Union due to a lack of clarity from regulators. Notes Meta, it will not be able to release upcoming AI models like Llama multimodel, which has the ability to understand images because of this.\nMeanwhile, Spotify points to its early investment in AI technology as a reason its streaming service became so successful in the first place, as it developed a personalized experience for each individual user.\n\u201cAs we look to the future of streaming, we see tremendous potential to use open-source AI to benefit the industry. This is especially important when it comes to how AI can help more artists get discovered. A simplified regulatory structure would not only accelerate the growth of open-source AI but also provide crucial support to European developers and the broader creator ecosystem that contributes to and thrives on these innovations,\u201d its post reads.\nReading between the lines, it\u2019s not a stretch to assume that Spotify would like to use Meta\u2019s AI technology to improve its products but is similarly impacted by the lack of clarity around AI regulations in the EU.\nOf course, neither of these companies are against regulation when it works to their advantage.\nFor instance, the two share a common enemy in Apple \u2014 specifically, its App Store monopoly, which saw EU regulators dubbing the iPhone maker a Big Tech \u201cgatekeeper\u201d before forcing it to open up to alternative app stores, app distribution methods and payment systems, among other things. Meta and Spotify didn\u2019t criticize the regulation itself, only how Apple had responded. In this case, Zuckerberg joined Ek in criticizing Apple\u2019s new business rules for EU developers under the region\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2014 as being so onerous that he doubted any developer would opt in. Spotify had also called Apple\u2019s compliance plan \u201cextortion\u201d and a \u201ccomplete and total farce.\u201d\nMeta and Spotify have a history of working together in recent years, having earlier teamed up on music initiatives that included a miniplayer on Facebook that streamed Spotify directly from the app.\n\ntitle3:\nAndrew Ng steps back at Landing AI after announcing new fund\ndescription3:\nAndrew Ng is stepping down from his role as CEO at Landing AI, the computer vision platform he founded in 2017. Dan Maloney, formerly the COO, will take the reins as Ng transitions to Executive Chairman to \u201ccontinue to help drive\u201d the tech and collaborate on \u201ckey decisions.\u201d\nFormerly of Google Brain, Coursera, and Baidu, Ng has seldom stayed put for long, and it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that his AI Fund just announced plans to raise another $120 million. Chances are Ng \u2014 who was appointed to Amazon\u2019s board in April \u2014 is simply choosing to focus on investing for now. At the same time, these executive reshufflings often precede other, bigger news, so we\u2019ll be watching for more news from Ng over the coming months.\n\ntitle4:\nApple rumor points to an iPhone 16, Watch, and AirPods launch event next month\ndescription4:\nWhen will we meet the iPhone 16 and other new items from Apple, like MacBook Pro laptops with M4 chips inside?\nBloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says that based on his sources, a launch event on September 10th could reveal the new iPhone 16 lineup, as well as the Apple Watch Series 10 and two different sets of new AirPods in time for them to go on sale as soon as September 20th. Bloomberg reports that the new phones will be similar to last year but with larger screens on the Pro models (reportedly going from 6.1 inches to 6.3 on the Pro and from 6.7 to 6.9 inches on the iPhone 16 Pro Max) and the addition of a dedicated camera button.\nThe other big updates may be new Apple Intelligence features that are in testing now and are due to start rolling out in iOS 18.1 after the launch of the new phones. For bigger changes to the hardware, Apple phone users may have to wait until next year, which could see the launch of a new \u201ciPhone 17 Slim.\u201d\nAs for new laptops with the fourth-generation Apple Silicon chips that first appeared in the latest iPad refresh, Gurman points to developer logs showing Macs in testing with four different versions of the M4 chip. Three pair the same 10-core CPU setup from the iPad Pro with a 10-core GPU, while the fourth one reports a CPU with eight cores evenly split between high performance and efficiency \u2014 but all of the ones noted have either 16GB or 32GB memory.\nApple doesn\u2019t usually launch new Macs at the same time as its iPhones, but if these debut later this year, it\u2019s possible that making room for local AI models will squeeze 8GB RAM models out of existence.\"\n\nResponse:",
