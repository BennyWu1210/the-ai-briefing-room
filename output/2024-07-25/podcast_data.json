Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday July 26), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI announces SearchGPT, its AI-powered search engine\ndescription0:\nOpenAI is announcing its much-anticipated entry into the search market, SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to information across the internet.\nThe search engine starts with a large textbox that asks the user \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d But rather than returning a plain list of links, SearchGPT tries to organize and make sense of them. In one example from OpenAI, the search engine summarizes its findings on music festivals and then presents short descriptions of the events followed by an attribution link.\nIn another example, it explains when to plant tomatoes before breaking down different varieties of the plant. After the results appear, you can ask follow-up questions or click the sidebar to open other relevant links. There\u2019s also a feature called \u201cvisual answers,\u201d but OpenAI didn\u2019t get back to The Verge before publication on exactly how this works.\nAn example of SearchGPT query. Image: OpenAI\nSearchGPT is just a \u201cprototype\u201d for now. The service is powered by the GPT-4 family of models and will only be accessible to 10,000 test users at launch, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood tells The Verge. Wood says that OpenAI is working with third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its search results. The goal is to eventually integrate the search features directly into ChatGPT.\nIt\u2019s the start of what could become a meaningful threat to Google, which has rushed to bake in AI features across its search engine, fearing that users will flock to competing products that offer the tools first. It also puts OpenAI in more direct competition with the startup Perplexity, which bills itself as an AI \u201canswer\u201d engine. Perplexity has recently come under criticism for an AI summaries feature that publishers claimed was directly ripping off their work.\nSearchGPT\u2019s \u201cvisual answers\u201d feature showcases an AI-generated video from OpenAI\u2019s Sora, via YouTube. Image: OpenAI\nOpenAI seems to have taken note of the blowback and says it\u2019s taking a markedly different approach. In a blog post, the company emphasized that SearchGPT was developed in collaboration with various news partners, which include organizations like the owners of The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, and Vox Media, the parent company of The Verge. \u201cNews partners gave valuable feedback, and we continue to seek their input,\u201d Wood says.\nPublishers will have a way to \u201cmanage how they appear in OpenAI search features,\u201d the company writes. They can opt out of having their content used to train OpenAI\u2019s models and still be surfaced in search.\n\u201cResponses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links\n\u201cSearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches,\u201d according to OpenAI\u2019s blog post. \u201cResponses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links.\u201d\nReleasing its search engine as a prototype helps OpenAI in a few different ways. First, if SearchGPT\u2019s results are wildly incorrect \u2014 like when Google rolled out AI Overviews and told us to put glue on our pizza \u2014 it\u2019s easier to say, well, it\u2019s a prototype! There\u2019s also potential for getting attributions wrong or maybe wholesale ripping off articles like Perplexity was accused of doing.\nThis new product has been whispered about for months now, with The Information reporting about its development in February, then Bloomberg reporting more in May. We reported at the same time that OpenAI had been aggressively trying to poach Google employees for a search team. Some X users also noticed a new website OpenAI has been working on that hinted toward the move.\nOpenAI has slowly been bringing ChatGPT more in touch with the real-time web. When GPT-3.5 was released, the AI model was already months out of date. Last September, OpenAI released a way for ChatGPT to browse the internet, called Browse with Bing, but it appears a lot more rudimentary than SearchGPT.\n\ntitle1:\nUber, Lyft, and DoorDash have finally won the Prop 22 gig worker battle\ndescription1:\nUber, Lyft, and DoorDash workers in California will remain independent contractors after the state\u2019s Supreme Court upheld Proposition 22, as reported by CalMatters. The unanimous decision issued on Thursday is a win for ridehailing and food delivery services, which have spent millions campaigning for Prop 22 to avoid having to classify gig workers as employees.\nWhile Prop 22 guarantees workers some protections, such as 120 percent of the local minimum wage for each hour spent driving, a health insurance stipend, and reimbursement for job-related injuries, it\u2019s far from the full range of benefits Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and other services would\u2019ve had to provide if workers were classified as employees.\nAfter voters passed Prop 22 in 2020, a group of Uber and Lyft drivers filed a lawsuit that challenged the law. Prop 22 was overturned in 2021 when a judge deemed it \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d but an appeals court upheld the law in March 2023. In the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision today, Justice Goodwin H. Liu reaffirmed that Prop 22 \u201cdoes not conflict\u201d with the state\u2019s constitution.\nUber, Lyft, and DoorDash have all issued responses in support of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cFrom the moment it became law, Prop 22 has been working for the millions of drivers and couriers that earn on platforms like ours,\u201d Uber writes in a post on its website. \u201cUber alone has delivered more than $1 billion in direct benefits to date.\u201d\nOpponents of Prop 22 are frustrated with the outcome. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that the state Supreme Court has allowed tech corporations to buy their way out of basic labor laws despite Proposition 22\u2019s inconsistencies with our state constitution,\u201d Lorena Gonzalez, the president of the California Federation of Labor Unions, says in a statement posted online. \u201cThese companies have upended our social contract, forcing workers and the public to take on the inherent risk created by this work, while they profit.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini AI is getting faster with its Flash upgrade\ndescription2:\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot will be able to respond to you more quickly and process more content in prompts thanks to an upgrade to the company\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model.\nWith the upgrade to 1.5 Flash, you\u2019ll see \u201cacross-the-board improvements in quality and latency, with especially noticeable improvements in reasoning and image understanding,\u201d Amar Subramanya, VP of engineering for Gemini, says in a blog post. Gemini\u2019s context window, or the amount of chunks of text that an AI model can process at once, is also getting quadrupled to 32K tokens, Subramanya says.\n1.5 Flash, which was announced at Google I/O in May, will be available in the free version of Gemini on the web and mobile starting today, according to Subramanya.\nGoogle is announcing a few other pieces of Gemini news, too. To help you find factual information on topics you\u2019re researching, the company is going to show links to related content in Gemini for \u201cfact-seeking prompts\u201d starting today, Subramanya says. You can see the links by clicking on a gray arrow at the end of a paragraph.\nGIF: Google\n\ntitle3:\nDexcom (DXCM) Q2 earnings report\ndescription3:\nThe Dexcom logo is seen on a smartphone screen and in the background.\nShares of Dexcom tumbled almost 40% in extended trading Thursday after the diabetes management company reported disappointing revenue for the second quarter and offered weak guidance.\nHere's how the company did:\nEarnings per share: 43 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents expected by LSEG\n43 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents expected by LSEG Revenue: $1 billion vs. $1.04 billion expected by LSEG\nDexcom's revenue increased 15% from $871.3 million a year earlier, according to a release. The company reported net income of $143.5 million, up from the $115.9 million in the same period last year.\nFor the third quarter, Dexcom expects revenue of $975 million to $1 billion to account for \"certain unique items impacting 2024 seasonality,\" the release said. Dexcom updated its full fiscal year guidance and now expects revenue of $4 billion and $4.05, down from the $4.20 billion to $4.35 billion it forecast last quarter.\nDexcom offers a suite of tools like continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for patients that have been diagnosed with diabetes.\nOn the earnings call, Dexcom CEO Kevin Sayer attributed the challenges to a restructuring of the company's sales team, fewer new customers than expected and lower revenue per user. Some of the shortfall had to do with customers taking advantage of rebates for the new CGM called the G7. Additionally, the company said it underperformed in the durable medical equipment (DME) channel.\n\"The DME distributors remain important partners for us in our business, and we've not executed well this quarter against these partnerships,\" Sayer said on the call. \"We need to refocus on those relationships.\"\nIn March, Dexcom announced its new over-the-counter CGM called Stelo had been cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Stelo is designed for patients with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. Dexcom said Thursday it will officially launch in August.\nPrior to Thursday's close, Dexcom shares were down 13% for the year, while the S&P 500 is up 13% over that stretch.\nAt the beginning of the Q&A portion of the earnings call, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus asked for more details on the substantial drop in guidance, expressing \"shock\" at how much disruption could be caused by a change in the structure of the sales force.\n\"I feel like there has to be more going on,\" Marcus said, and asked whether the surging popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss treatments is having an impact.\nSayer responded by saying the company is \"short a large number of new patients as to where we thought we would be at this point in time.\" He said the sales force reshuffling, which led to changes in geographic coverage, was more dramatic than expected as physicians were now dealing with different reps.\nWith respect to the DME struggles, Sayer said the company lost customers \"who have the highest annual revenue per year.\" And he added that G7 rebate eligibility was three times faster than over the prior product, the G6.\nJereme Sylvain, Dexcom's finance chief, said all that adds up to a $300 million shortfall in the company's guidance for the year at the top end.\n\"Certainly not something we're happy about,\" Sylvain said. He said that in the interest of \"full transparency,\" the company needed to provide clarity \"about what the impact is for the balance of the year.\"\nWATCH: Dexcom CEO Kevin Sayer\n\ntitle4:\nMark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp has 100M monthly active users in the US\ndescription4:\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday on his channel that WhatsApp now has more than 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., a country where SMS/texts is a popular mode of communication.\nThe announcement is the first time WhatsApp has released data about users in the U.S. The company also noted that more than 50% of WhatsApp\u2019s users have iPhones, which is not surprising given that iOS has the majority market share in the country.\nWhatsApp is a popular app worldwide, with more than 2 billion active users monthly. The company has historically focused on countries like India, which is WhatsApp\u2019s largest user base with more than 500 million monthly active users, and Brazil and Indonesia.\nWhatsApp has recently ramped up its marketing push in the U.S. In the past few years, WhatsApp has placed ad campaigns, placements in Times Square and TV spots emphasizing privacy and end-to-end encryption protection. Most recently, it started a national campaign about WhatsApp by bringing back some of the cast of the TV show \u201cModern Family.\u201d\nJust like Google, Meta has emphasized in its marketing the differences between green bubble and blue bubble devices caused by Apple\u2019s iMessage. But now that Apple has adopted Rich Communication Services (RCS), Android users can send and receive high-quality media files and have options to look at typing indicators and read receipts. The messages will still be green, though, according to screenshots of Apple\u2019s website.\nHowever, Meta is still pushing its cross-platform app by highlighting some other features, such as polls, high-quality video calling and reactions. The company is capping off the announcement with another marketing campaign by placing a 200-foot bubble between the Apple and Samsung stores in The Americana Mall in Los Angeles.\"\n\nResponse:",
