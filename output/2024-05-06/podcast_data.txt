        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.
        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.

Apple iPad event 2024: Watch Apple unveil new iPads right here
description0:
We’re still well over a month out from WWDC, but Apple went ahead and snuck in another event. Tomorrow, May 7 at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, the company is set to unveil the latest additions to the iPad line. According to the rumor mill, that list includes: a new iPad Pro, iPad Air, Apple Pencil and a keyboard case.
More surprisingly, the event may also see the launch of the new M4 chip, a little over six months after the company unveiled three new M3 chips in one fell swoop. Why the quick silicon refresh? Well, for starters, word on the street is that Apple launched the M3 later than expected (likely owing to supply chain issues), forcing the company to launch all three chips at the same event.
Couple that with the fact that Microsoft is rumored to be launching its own third-party silicon at Build at the end of May, and you start to understand why the company opted not to wait. An announcement may be even more pressing, given that the Microsoft/ARM chips are said to offer “industry-leading performance” — an apparent shot across Apple’s bow. Could a new chip also mean new Macs? That would be a short refresh cycle for the current crop, but it’s certainly not out of the realm of possibility.
What does seem certain, however, is a new iPad Pro with an OLED display, a 12.9-inch iPad Air and new gestures for the Apple Pencil. Also, expect plenty of AI chatter. It’s 2024, after all. You can watch along live at the link below, and stay tuned to TechCrunch for news as it breaks.

Biden administration plans $285M in CHIPS Act funding for digital twins
description1:
President Joe Biden’s administration is looking to fund efforts that improve semiconductor manufacturing by using digital twins.
Digital twins are virtual models used to test and optimize physical objects and systems. For example, auto manufacturers are looking to use digital twins of their factories to experiment with new manufacturing processes without disrupting production.
The Biden administration announced it will be accepting applications for what it anticipates to be a total of $285 million in funding for work that includes research into semiconductor digital twin development, building and supporting combined physical/digital facilities, industry demonstration projects, workforce training and operation of what it says will be a new CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute.
During a press briefing Sunday, Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and National Institute of Standards and Technology Director Laurie E. Locascio said digital twins could reduce chip development and manufacturing costs, while also enabling more collaborative processes around chip design and development.
“Currently, no country has invested at the scale needed or successfully unified the industry to unlock the enormous potential of digital twin technology for breakthrough discoveries,” Locascio said.
This funding is part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, a $280 billion bill that included $52.7 billion to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing. At the time, President Biden noted that the United States had gone from producing 40% of semiconductors worldwide to less than 10%.
Echoing another major theme in the administration’s rhetoric, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar said Sunday that when the CHIPS Act was passed, semiconductor manufacturing had become “dangerously concentrated in just one part of the world” (presumably referring to China).
There will be an informational webinar about applications on May 8. Organizations that can apply include nonprofits, universities, governments and for-profit companies that are “domestic entities” (incorporated in the United States, with their principal place of business here).

Chinese fintech Ant Group doubles down on global expansion with Alipay+

Chinese fintech major Ant Group is looking to boost its global presence via its digital offering, Alipay+, as it seeks to connect mobile payment apps around the world. "What we found is that people want to use their home e-wallets when they travel abroad. So they don't want to have to load their card into another app that they don't know as well," Douglas Feagin, senior vice president of Ant Group, an affiliate of Chinese tech giant Alibaba , told CNBC. The group's global arm, Ant International, introduced Alipay+ in 2020, allowing foreigners to use apps from their home countries to make payments in China by scanning QR codes of Alipay – Ant Group's largely domestically-focused platform – and in other countries via local partners. "We see a huge opportunity for expansion and the relatively broad coverage we have in Asia – we [would] like to replicate in places like Middle East, Latam and Europe," said Feagin. "People from all these regions are going to other regions, so a big opportunity to expand."
Ant had invested in country-specific e-wallets across Asia, but the CEOs wanted to take their products overseas, said Feagin, also president of Ant International. The company had some cross-border tourism business from customers traveling outside of China, said Feagin, but that was "mostly focused on where the Chinese tourists go." Ant had entered Europe and the U.S., where Chinese tourism was booming before the Covid-19 pandemic, through Alipay. Ant with its Alipay+ offering seeks to make the most of the early inroads into those markets. "We had the benefit that Alipay was already accepted in many merchants around the world so one of our first steps was [to] convert those merchants to Alipay+ merchants. So instead of just accepting a wallet, they can accept many wallets," said Feagin. Alipay+ now connects 88 million merchants in 57 countries and regions to 1.5 billion consumer accounts across more than 25 e-wallets and bank apps, according to Ant.
Growth markets
watch now
There are also growth opportunities in the firm's established markets like Singapore and South Korea, for instance a lot of people use mobile payments in China, but still far fewer compared with people in other countries, said Feagin. "There's huge room to grow. I think a lot of people just think of using traditional payment methods when they go abroad." "When you think about the big markets that receive a lot of tourists, like Thailand and Japan, the chances for payment from mobile apps to grow are enormous."
From problems to solutions
Ant Group's future in China became uncertain when regulators pulled the plug on its initial public offering in November 2020. Ant was also forced to restructure to become a financial holding company regulated by the central bank.

Stack Overflow signs deal with OpenAI to supply data to its models
description3:
OpenAI is collaborating with Stack Overflow, the Q&A forum for software developers, to improve its generative AI models’ performance on programming-related tasks.
As a result of the partnership, announced Monday, OpenAI’s models, including models served through its ChatGPT chatbot platform, should get better over time at answering programming-related questions, the two companies say. At the same time, Stack Overflow will benefit from OpenAI’s expertise in developing new generative AI integrations on the Stack Overflow platform.
The first set of features will go live by the end of June.
The tie-up with OpenAI is a remarkable reversal for Stack Overflow, which initially banned responses from ChatGPT on its platform over fears of spammy responses.
Stack Overflow began experimenting with generative AI features last April, promising to craft models that “reward” devs who contribute knowledge to the platform. In July, the company launched a conversational search tool that lets users pose queries and receive answers based on Stack Overflow’s database of over 58 million questions and answers, along with tools for businesses to fine-tune searches on their own documentation and knowledge bases.
Some members of Stack Overflow’s developer community rebelled against the changes, pointing out concerns related to the validity of information generated by AI, information overload and data privacy for individual contributors on the platform.
There was at least some basis for those concerns. An analysis of more than 150 million lines of code committed to project repos over the past several years by GitClear found that generative AI dev tools are resulting in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases. Elsewhere, security researchers have warned that such tools can amplify existing bugs and security issues in software projects.
But despite the apparent flaws, developers are embracing generative AI tools for at least some coding tasks. In a Stack Overflow poll from June 2023, 44% of developers said that they use AI tools in their development process now while 26% plan to soon.
This has precipitated something of an existential crisis for Stack Overflow. Traffic to the platform has reportedly dipped significantly since the release of capable new generative AI models last year — models that in many cases were trained on data from Stack Overflow.
So now, as it cuts costs, Stack Overflow is pursuing licensing agreements with AI providers.
The company’s deal with OpenAI — the financial terms of which weren’t disclosed — comes after Stack Overflow partnered with Google to enrich Google’s Gemini models with Stack Overflow data and work with Google to bring more AI-powered features to its platform. Stack Overflow stressed at the time that the agreement wasn’t exclusive — and indeed, that turned out to be the case.
Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO of Stack Overflow, previously said that 10% of the platform’s nearly 600 staff was focused on its AI strategy, and has described potential additional revenue from the strategy as key to ensuring Stack Overflow can keep attracting users and maintaining high-quality information.
“Stack Overflow is the world’s largest developer community,” Chandrasekar said in a press release this morning. “Through [our] industry-leading partnership with OpenAI, we strive to redefine the developer experience, fostering efficiency and collaboration through the power of community, best-in-class data, and AI experiences. Our goal with OverflowAPI, and our work to advance the era of socially responsible AI, is to set new standards with vetted, trusted, and accurate data that will be the foundation on which technology solutions are built and delivered to our user.”

Police resurrect Lockbit's site and troll the ransomware gang
description4:
An international coalition of police agencies have resurrected the dark web site of the notorious LockBit ransomware gang, which they had seized earlier this year, teasing new revelations about the group.
On Sunday, what was once LockBit’s official darknet site reappeared online with new posts that suggest the authorities are planning to release new information about the hackers in the next 24 hours, as of this writing.
The posts have titles such as “Who is LockBitSupp?”, “What have we learnt”, “More LB hackers exposed”, and “What have we been doing?”
In February, a law enforcement coalition that included the U.K.’s National Crime Agency, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as forces from Germany, Finland, France, Japan and others announced that they had infiltrated LockBit’s official site. The coalition seized the site and replaced information on it with their own press release and other information in a clear attempt to troll and warn the hackers that the authorities were on to them.
The February operation also included the arrests of two alleged LockBit members in Ukraine and Poland, the takedown of 34 servers across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S., as well as the seizure of more than 200 cryptocurrency wallets belonging to the hackers.
The NCA and the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Official announcement in 24hrs #Cronos Watch this space pic.twitter.com/ttKd58QVFL — National Crime Agency (NCA) (@NCA_UK) May 6, 2024
LockBit first emerged in 2019, and has since become one of the most prolific ransomware gangs in the world, netting millions of dollars in ransom payments. The group has proven to be very resilient. Even after February’s takedown, the group has re-emerged with a new dark web leak site, which has been actively updated with new alleged victims.
All the new posts on the seized website, except for one, have a countdown that ends at 9 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 7, suggesting that’s when law enforcement will announce the new actions against LockBit. Another post says the site will be shut down in four days.
Since the authorities announced what they called “Operation Cronos” against LockBit in February, the group’s leader, known as LockBitSupp has claimed in an interview that law enforcement has exaggerated its access to the criminal organization as well as the effect of its takedown.
On Sunday, the hacking collective vx-underground wrote on X that they had spoken to LockBit’s administrative staff, who had told them the police were lying.
“I don’t understand why they’re putting on this little show. They’re clearly upset we continue to work,” the staff said, according to vx-underground.
The identity of LockBitSupp is still unknown, although that could change soon. One of the new posts on the seized LockBit site promises to reveal the hacker’s identity on Tuesday. It has to be noted, however, that the previous version of the seized site also appeared to promise to reveal the gang leader’s identity, but eventually did not."

我是wall-e，这是您的ai briefing星期一5月6日简报。苹果公司计划在明天，即5月7日上午7点pt/上午10点et举行一场活动，届时将展示ipad系列的最新产品。这包括：一款新的ipad pro、ipad air、apple pencil以及键盘套。更令人惊讶的是，该活动还可能发布新的m4芯片，距离公司一次性推出三款m3芯片仅过去六个多月。为什么会出现这样快速的硅片更新？部分原因在于供应链问题导致m3芯片发布晚于预期，迫使公司在同一事件中推出所有三款芯片。加之，微软预计将在5月底的build大会上发布其第三方硅片，这可能是苹果决定不再等待的另一个原因。鉴于微软/arm芯片据说提供“行业领先的性能”，这显然是对苹果的挑战。

拜登政府计划为数字孪生提供2.85亿美元的chips法案资金，旨在利用数字孪生改进半导体制造。数字孪生是用于测试和优化物理对象和系统的虚拟模型。例如，汽车制造商希望使用工厂的数字孪生来试验新的制造流程而不中断生产。

中国金融科技巨头蚂蚁集团正在通过其数字服务alipay+加大全球扩张的力度，旨在连接全球的移动支付应用。蚂蚁集团全球业务负责人douglas feagin表示，该集团看到了在中东、拉丁美洲和欧洲等地区扩张的巨大机会。

stack overflow与openai合作，旨在提升其针对编程相关任务的生成式ai模型性能。通过这一合作，stack overflow的数据库中超过5800万个问题和答案将有助于openai的模型训练，并且stack overflow还将从openai开发新的生成式ai集成功能中受益。
