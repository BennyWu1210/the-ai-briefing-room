Waystar said its expected price would be between $20 and $23 per share in May. Shares closed down more than 3% to $20.70 on Friday.\nThe IPO market has been largely dormant since late 2021 when the extended bull market turned and investors began to worry about a weakening economy. Few technology companies have been willing to try and go public since then, and no digital health companies had a public exit in 2023, according to a report from Rock Health.\nBut the broader venture-backed tech market may be beginning to thaw. Social media platform Reddit , data center connectivity chip vendor Astera Labs and data software management maker Rubrik have all gone public this year. Health tech company Tempus AI has also issued a preliminary prospectus this year.\nBased on Waystar's initial share price, the company's market cap is about $3.5 billion. The stock is trading under the ticker symbol \"WAY.\"\nWaystar offers health-care payment and revenue cycle management tools and facilitates more than 5 billion payment transactions annually, according to its prospectus. The company was formed in 2017 after the health-care payment companies Navicure and ZirMed merged.\n\"We're excited about the opportunity to be a public company because we think it helps us with awareness, helps us with credibility, helps us improve our capital structure and allows for further investments in areas such as generative AI,\" Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins told CNBC's \"The Exchange\" Friday.\nFor the quarter ending March 31, Waystar generated revenue of $224.8 million, up 18% from $191.1 million in the same period last year. Waystar reported a net loss of $15.9 million for the quarter compared with $10.6 million a year ago.\nThe company said it plans to use the money from the offering to pay off existing debt. JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs and Barclays are leading the offering.\nWATCH: Tech IPOs face hurdle\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft says Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs will be off by default\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at an event on Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington, on May 20, 2024.\nMicrosoft said an artificial intelligence feature on new PCs that captures screenshots and enables searching of user activity will be off by default after security researchers determined that attackers could access the underlying data.\nThe Recall feature was one of the main capabilities Microsoft showed during a press briefing last month for forthcoming Copilot+ PCs with AI computing power onboard.\n\"If you don't proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default,\" Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's head of Windows and Surface devices, wrote in a blog post Friday.\nMicrosoft has been trying to balance competing interests of late as it moves to incorporate new generative AI tools into its products and to keep up with the competition. While the market is evolving rapidly, user privacy and security are under a microscope. A U.S. government review board recently criticized Microsoft's handling of China's breach of U.S. government officials' email accounts.\nMicrosoft has already added the Copilot conversational chatbot into Windows in a way that resembles OpenAI's popular ChatGPT. Both ChatGPT and Copilot rely on servers in the cloud to perform necessary computations and then send back responses to PCs. Recall is different in that it keeps data on users' computers and doesn't need to access supplemental computing power over the internet.\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, directed employees to put security first and announced changes to its security practices following the U.S. government report.\nAfter Microsoft announced Recall, which can search through a log of previous actions on PCs, industry experts began questioning the potential for hackers to retrieve users' information.\nSecurity practitioners released software called Total Recall that displays data Recall collects.\n\"Windows Recall stores everything locally in an unencrypted SQLite database, and the screenshots are simply saved in a folder on your PC,\" they wrote in a description of Total Recall on GitHub. They expressed concern about attackers developing tools that can look for usernames and passwords contained in Recall screenshots.\nMicrosoft is adding security protections to Recall in addition to requiring people to manually turn it on once Copilot+ PCs become available on June 18. The search index database will be encrypted, Microsoft said.\n\"Windows Hello enrollment is required to enable Recall,\" Davuluri wrote. \"In addition, proof of presence is also required to view your timeline and search in Recall.\"\nWith Windows Hello, users prove their identity by entering a PIN number, showing their face to the PC camera or providing a fingerprint.\n\"I think overall having a choice around opting in on home systems will save a lot of people security problems further down the line,\" Kevin Beaumont, a former Microsoft cybersecurity analyst who criticized the original implementation of Recall, said in a Friday post on X. \"It never should have been enabled by default.\"\n\ntitle2:\nAfter ChatGPT and the rise of chatbots, investors pour into AI agents\ndescription2:\nRafael Henrique | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nEarlier this year, financial services company Klarna said its artificial intelligence agent, powered by OpenAI, had taken over two-thirds of customer chats and was doing work equivalent to that of 700 full-time agents. That was after just one month of use. Alexander Kvamme, CEO of customer engagement startup Echo AI, told CNBC that Klarna's announcement in February may have been the first sign of AI agents \"having their ChatGPT moment.\" OpenAI released the ChatGPT chatbot to the public in late 2022, giving the public a taste of how new generative AI chatbots could provide much more thorough, creative and conversational answers to web queries compared with traditional search, which is how consumers sought online information for the prior 25 years. Google , Microsoft and others followed with rival products. The industry quickly moved past text responses and into AI-generated photos and videos. Now comes the rise of AI agents. Rather than just providing answers \u2014 the realm of chatbots and image generators \u2014 agents are built for productivity and to complete tasks. They're AI tools that are able to make decisions, for better or worse, \"without a human in the loop,\" Kvamme said. Grace Isford, a partner at venture firm Lux Capital, said there's been a \"dramatic increase\" in interest among tech investors when it comes to startups focused on building AI agents. They've collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars and seen their valuations climb alongside the broader generative AI market. Generative AI exploded in 2023, with $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals, a more than 260% increase in deal value from a year earlier, according to PitchBook. Meanwhile, the non-AI investing landscape has been in an extended lull for well over two years following record financings during the Covid pandemic.\nwatch now\nIf 2023 was the year of peak AI hype, 2024 is the year of early deployments. \"It has really been a torrent of innovation that has hit the market since the introduction of ChatGPT,\" Jared Spataro, Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI at Work, told CNBC. Microsoft is the biggest backer of OpenAI and has invested billions of dollars on its own generative AI models and products, in addition to the billions it's poured into the ChatGPT developer. The term AI agents isn't neatly defined across the tech sector. Industry experts who spoke to CNBC about the emerging trend generally viewed agents as a step beyond chatbots, in that they're typically designed for specific business functions and can be customized on the big AI models. Think of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's multifaceted AI assistant from the Marvel Universe. AI agents are often described as advanced generative AI tools that can do multistep, complex tasks on a user\u2019s behalf and generate their own to-do lists, so that users don't have to walk them through the process step-by-step. \"An assistant is not just giving you the answer, but automating a series of steps,\" said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer at digital analytics company Amplitude.\nHow Microsoft and Google are playing\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an earnings call earlier this year that he wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user's behalf, though there is \"a lot of execution ahead.\" Executives from Meta and Google have also touted their work in pushing AI assistants to become increasingly productive. At Google I/O in May, Google announced Project Astra, the company's latest advancement toward its AI assistant that's being built by Google's DeepMind AI unit. In Google\u2019s demo video, the assistant, using video and audio, was able to help the user remember where they left their glasses, review code and answer questions about an object that it was shown. It's just a prototype for now, but Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said he hopes to roll it out to users later this year. The demo came a day after OpenAI showcased a similar audio back-and-forth conversation with ChatGPT, positioning it more as an AI assistant that can function as a conversationalist, language translator, math tutor and co-writer of code. Microsoft followed at its Build developer conference by announcing a partnership with Cognition AI, which will bring Cognition's own AI agent, called Devin, to customers. Cognition bills Devin as the \u201cfirst AI software engineer.\u201d Devin quickly caused a stir on social media for its ability to handle multistep processes. Instead of just generating simple lines of code, Devin creates a problem-solving process, writes the code, tests it and then ships it.\nwatch now\nMartin Kon, operating chief of enterprise AI startup Cohere, said AI agents could start doing work such as booking a plane ticket and expensing it, offering a suggested interest rate on a loan, or emailing a customer about arrival time and updating Salesforce accordingly. To date, the tools have largely been limited to tasks such as helping write code. At Microsoft's GitHub, for example, roughly 46% of all code \"across all programming languages\" was AI-generated, CEO Thomas Dohmke wrote in a blog post in early 2023. While the line between an AI coding tool and a true AI agent is blurry, most experts who spoke with CNBC said the defining characteristic of an agent is that it goes well beyond a single use case and starts to approach an all-capable personal assistant. Anthropic and other startups are already working toward that goal. The first step is giving their chatbots the ability to interact with external tools and services on behalf of the customer. Microsoft's Spataro said the process of developing his company's Copilot coding agent has \"kind of been like being strapped to a rocketship.\" A big part of what Microsoft is doing, he said, is moving from one- or two-step tasks to multistep tasks. That could involve looking at a user's calendar and giving a 30-second outlook on what to prioritize for the day. Fred Havemeyer, head of U.S. AI and software research at Macquarie, wrote in a recent note to investors that the firm is looking forward to seeing more AI agents. \"We think agentic AI, which can self-direct towards achieving tasks, will be the tools that unlock the value of GenAI for everyday users,\" Havemeyer wrote. Romain Huet, OpenAI's head of developer experience, told CNBC that the concept of AI agents came into focus last year, but people quickly realized there was work to be done to make the tools more autonomous. \"We have the models that become more and more powerful, so we can now capture user intent much better than before, but we're also still pretty early on that journey at building agents,\" Huet said. The big advancement, he said, will be when an AI agent can know your preferences and \"take action on your behalf\" without you asking.\nStartups raise big money\nAI agent startups are reeling in hefty piles of cash from investors. They're not the billion-dollar-plus financings that have been going into the AI model companies, but valuations are still far ahead of business fundamentals. Adept, which is led by alumni of OpenAI and Google, received a valuation of over $1 billion last year. The company says on its website that its technology \"navigates the complexity of software tools so you don't have to.\" H, a French AI agent startup, raised a $220 million seed round in May from investors including Amazon, Samsung, UiPath and Google ex-CEO Eric Schmidt. Artisan AI, a Y Combinator-backed startup working on AI agents that it bills as \"AI employees for enterprise,\" recently completed a $7.3 million seed round and says it's onboarded more than 100 companies so far. Artisan AI founder and CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack said it wasn't possible to begin working on true AI agents until 2022 because that's when chatbots such as ChatGPT first made it possible for the average consumer to interact with such tools. \"People talk about how the VC market is down in general,\" Carmichael-Jack said. \"But for us it's like 2021 in AI startups.\u201d Braden Hancock worked at Facebook Research and Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Lab before co-founding Snorkel AI in 2019. He said the market is in a \"similar hype cycle\" to that of self-driving cars. And broader AI agents will similarly take a long time to hit the mainstream, he said. Hancock said agents must be \"many times\" better before people are \"willing to accept putting something on autopilot.\" He added that, when it comes to having technology sign your name and make money transfers on your behalf, \"there's a really high bar.\" Kanjun Qiu's three-year-old startup, Imbue, has been valued at more than $1 billion, with backing from Amazon's Alexa Fund and Eric Schmidt. Based on the company's own user research, Qiu said the current characterization of AI agents \u2014 as generally intelligent personal assistants that handle delegated tasks \u2014 is not what users actually want, since, by design, they\u2019re \"not fully trustworthy.\" \"Even as CEO, it's hard for me to delegate things to my executive assistant,\" Qiu said. \"I've had her for two years, and she's amazing.\" For new things, Qiu said, \"It's still hard for me to fully know, 'Okay, is this going to come back the way I expected?'\" Imbue is developing ways for people to make their own AI software agents \u2014 without coding \u2014 to run in the background for their personalized needs, whether it's creating a way to track the news or building a bot to book travel. These types of AI models wouldn't need to train on user data, since each use case would be personalized. Instead of delegating tasks to an agent built by the likes of OpenAI or Google, which would be centralized and controlled by those companies, Imbue imagines agents putting control in the hands of users. \"There's a way of thinking about agents as enabling every person to make software,\" Qiu said. The user is \"asking the agent to write code on the computer, to make the computer do what I want to do.\" WATCH: 'We're a decade away from' solving AI\n\ntitle3:\nRippling bans former employees who work at competitors like Deel and Workday from its tender offer stock sale\ndescription3:\nInvestor demand has been so strong for shares of hot HR startup Rippling \u2013 over $2 billion worth of term sheets, it says \u2013 that it is allowing former employees to also participate in its giant, tender offer sale, the company told TechCrunch.\nBut there is one big exception: it has banned former employees who work for a handful of competitors from selling their stock. A small group of ex employees has been trying to get the company to alter this policy, TechCrunch has learned, but so far, to no avail.\nRippling has also told employees who have previously sold shares, particularly if those sales were outside its previous tender offer, that they would not be authorized to sell as many shares this time around.\nTo recap: in April, TechCrunch broke the news that Rippling was doing a giant tender offer of up to $590 million for employees and existing investors, led by Coatue, along with a smaller $200 million Series F for the company. All told the deal valued HR software startup Rippling at $13.5 billion, the company said.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first-and-only sale that let employees and longtime investors cash out of some shares, but it\u2019s by far the biggest and most profitable. Another smaller one took place in 2021, founder and CEO Parker Conrad told TechCrunch\u2019s GM and EIC Connie Loizos.\nThe rules for this one, according to a summary of details seen by TechCrunch, were:\nthe offer was open to both current and former employees\nit involved options, not restricted stock units (the stock that employees had to buy, not the ones granted with restrictions as part of their comp packages)\nemployees were eligible to sell up to 25% of their vested equity but the company was including in that count any shares they sold in the previous tender offer\nif an employee sold shares via any method outside of a company tender offer, the company warned it would double count those shares against the 25%\nformer employees working for \u201ccompetitors\u201d were not eligible to participate\nRippling tells TechCrunch that the employees who work for the following companies are excluded: Workday, Paylocity, Gusto, Deel, Remote.com, Justworks, Hibob, Personio. Sources tell TechCrunch that employees at those companies received no information about the tender offer, but heard about their exclusion through the grapevine.\nNone of the former employees TechCrunch spoke to were surprised to hear one name on the list: Deel. Or, according to a post on Blind, \u201cEveryone who has options is eligible, even former employees. Except if you went to Deel then you\u2019re screwed lol.\u201d\nWhen some former employees realized they were being excluded from the sale, a few wrote a scathing letter to Conrad and Rippling\u2019s top lawyer, Vanessa Wu, imploring Rippling to change its mind. Rippling refused to do so.\nIndeed there was quite a bit of internal drama involving the letter, as well as the equally scathing letters, seen by TechCrunch, that Rippling sent to some of them in response. The drama involved some people distancing themselves from the letter and many allegations of wrongdoing on both sides that TechCrunch could not independently verify. One person who was reportedly dragged into the letter drama told TechCrunch they wanted nothing more to do with any of it.\nWhy is Rippling excluding ex-employees at competitors?\nThe company told TechCrunch it was omitting employees at competitors because it was concerned that the sensitive information \u201cincluding detailed financial information and risk factors\u201d disclosed in the offer paperwork could wind up shared with competitors.\n\u201cRippling put together a tender offer for the benefit of its employees, ex-employees, and early investors. Rippling chose to be uncharacteristically broad in its approach to this tender offer (1) because Rippling wanted to be able to provide liquidity to its early employees and investors, and also, (2) because there was so much demand (received over $2B in term sheets),\u201d Rippling VP of communications Bobby Whithorne told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.\n\u201cHowever, tender offer rules require companies to share significant sensitive information, including private company financials, which reasonably are not materials that any company would want in the hands of its competitors. As a result, while most companies exclude former employees entirely, Rippling took the more measured approach of excluding only those former employees who currently work at a list of eight competitors with ambitions to build global HR and payroll products,\u201d Whithorne said.\nTo be sure, as a private company, Rippling certainly has the freedom to place restrictions on participation in its stock sales.\nRippling vs Deel, a competitive feud?\nSeveral sources said that Deel is a particularly touchy subject at Rippling. Both companies play into the rivalry with marketing that touts their own tech stack is better than the other.\nRippling\u2019s hard-charging CEO Conrad is internally revered as a product genius but is also known as a competitive guy who thrives on rivalry, these sources said.\nHe built Rippling into a $13.5 billion HR tech success with a product that tightly integrates payroll, benefits, recruiting, and a whole bunch of other services. He also famously built a previous HR tech startup, Zenefits, into one of the fastest-growing startups of its time until it hit a world of trouble that ultimately led to his ouster. Then he founded Rippling, which has also grown like dandelions under his care. During his time at Zenefits, Conrad also had a very public spat with competitor ADP.\nDespite the rivalry, Deel was once a customer of Rippling, though it no longer is, sources tell us.\nOne other thing to note about excluding ex-Rippling employees working at competitors is that, it\u2019s not only about making a profit on their stock. Stock options can be costly. In addition to the price of the stock, employees may face huge tax bills on options they exercise from the paper gains of the value of the stock. Sometimes selling a portion of their stake, if they can, is a way for them to offset such tax bills.\nWhen asked about this, Rippling\u2019s Whithorne said that the company has \u201ctried to issue Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) wherever possible (all US employees) which enable employees to defer tax obligations at the time of exercise.\u201d\nAll employees, current or former, will be able to sell their stock one day, after a lockup period, after the company goes public. But it\u2019s not clear when Rippling will stage an offering. The company isn\u2019t likely in need of more capital at the moment. It just raised that new $200 million infusion, on top of the emergency $500 million it famously raised in 2023 as part of the whole SVB crisis.\nFor several of the people impacted by this decision, however, it\u2019s not just the money. It\u2019s also about hurt feelings that their former company believes they would do illegal or unethical things and so they are being preemptively left out of a lucrative deal.\n\u201cYour company doesn\u2019t love you, or value you. They are always going to do what is in their best interest. So do what\u2019s in your best interest,\u201d one source said.\nGot a tip about a startup culture you\u2019ve experienced?

These were selected after the agency put out a request for proposals in April.\nThe titles don\u2019t really say very much at all about the respective proposals \u2014 for example, it\u2019s no surprise that SpaceX is offering up Starship for a mission to Mars, but how exactly the vehicle will be enabled to collect and return samples is still unclear. That\u2019s the whole point of the study period: to help NASA understand whether there are viable alternative mission designs or mission elements to bring Martian samples home safely.\nAccording to the request for proposal, studies could be for complete overhauls of the mission design, or for designs that include elements of NASA\u2019s MSR mission or NASA\u2019s Artemis program.\nNASA turned to private industry after finally admitting that its architecture for MSR is incredibly complicated. In fact, it\u2019s a bit of a misnomer to even call it a single mission, given that the plan involved the Perseverance rover, a novel sample retrieval lander, a rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, and an Earth return orbiter. These vehicles would need to work in perfect synchronicity to collect and transport the samples.\nLast year, an independent review board recommended that NASA revisit the mission design given the concerns about the technical features and the high costs. So the agency is doing just that: In documents related to the RFP, NASA said its looking for a less complex mission design and one that would reduce the total costs to the agency. The agency also said it was looking for the earliest possible return date.\nCompanies will start work in July and complete their studies in October.\"\n\nResponse:",
