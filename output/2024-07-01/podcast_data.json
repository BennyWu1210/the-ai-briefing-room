Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday July 2), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAnthropic looks to fund a new, more comprehensive generation of AI benchmarks\ndescription0:\nAnthropic is launching a program to fund the development of new types of benchmarks capable of evaluating the performance and impact of AI models, including generative models like its own Claude.\nUnveiled on Monday, Anthropic\u2019s program will dole out payments to third-party organizations that can, as the company puts it in a blog post, \u201ceffectively measure advanced capabilities in AI models.\u201d Those interested can submit applications to be evaluated on a rolling basis.\n\u201cOur investment in these evaluations is intended to elevate the entire field of AI safety, providing valuable tools that benefit the whole ecosystem,\u201d Anthropic wrote on its official blog. \u201cDeveloping high-quality, safety-relevant evaluations remains challenging, and the demand is outpacing the supply.\u201d\nAs we\u2019ve highlighted before, AI has a benchmarking problem. The most commonly cited benchmarks for AI today do a poor job of capturing how the average person actually uses the systems being tested. There are also questions as to whether some benchmarks, particularly those released before the dawn of modern generative AI, even measure what they purport to measure, given their age.\nThe very-high-level, harder-than-it-sounds solution Anthropic is proposing is creating challenging benchmarks with a focus on AI security and societal implications via new tools, infrastructure and methods.\nThe company calls specifically for tests that assess a model\u2019s ability to accomplish tasks like carrying out cyberattacks, \u201cenhance\u201d weapons of mass destruction (e.g. nuclear weapons) and manipulate or deceive people (e.g. through deepfakes or misinformation). For AI risks pertaining to national security and defense, Anthropic says it\u2019s committed to developing an \u201cearly warning system\u201d of sorts for identifying and assessing risks, although it doesn\u2019t reveal in the blog post what such a system might entail.\nAnthropic also says it intends its new program to support research into benchmarks and \u201cend-to-end\u201d tasks that probe AI\u2019s potential for aiding in scientific study, conversing in multiple languages and mitigating ingrained biases, as well as self-censoring toxicity.\nTo achieve all this, Anthropic envisions new platforms that allow subject-matter experts to develop their own evaluations and large-scale trials of models involving \u201cthousands\u201d of users. The company says it\u2019s hired a full-time coordinator for the program and that it might purchase or expand projects it believes have the potential to scale.\n\u201cWe offer a range of funding options tailored to the needs and stage of each project,\u201d Anthropic writes in the post, though an Anthropic spokesperson declined to provide any further details about those options. \u201cTeams will have the opportunity to interact directly with Anthropic\u2019s domain experts from the frontier red team, fine-tuning, trust and safety and other relevant teams.\u201d\nAnthropic\u2019s effort to support new AI benchmarks is a laudable one \u2014 assuming, of course, there\u2019s sufficient cash and manpower behind it. But given the company\u2019s commercial ambitions in the AI race, it might be a tough one to completely trust.\nIn the blog post, Anthropic is rather transparent about the fact that it wants certain evaluations it funds to align with the AI safety classifications it developed (with some input from third parties like the nonprofit AI research org METR). That\u2019s well within the company\u2019s prerogative. But it may also force applicants to the program into accepting definitions of \u201csafe\u201d or \u201crisky\u201d AI that they might not agree with.\nA portion of the AI community is also likely to take issue with Anthropic\u2019s references to \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d AI risks, like nuclear weapons risks. Many experts say there\u2019s little evidence to suggest AI as we know it will gain world-ending, human-outsmarting capabilities anytime soon, if ever. Claims of imminent \u201csuperintelligence\u201d serve only to draw attention away from the pressing AI regulatory issues of the day, like AI\u2019s hallucinatory tendencies, these experts add.\nIn its post, Anthropic writes that it hopes its program will serve as \u201ca catalyst for progress towards a future where comprehensive AI evaluation is an industry standard.\u201d That\u2019s a mission the many open, corporate-unaffiliated efforts to create better AI benchmarks can identify with. But it remains to be seen whether those efforts are willing to join forces with an AI vendor whose loyalty ultimately lies with shareholders.\n\ntitle1:\nRobinhood snaps up Pluto to add AI tools to its investing app\ndescription1:\nInvestment app Robinhood is adding more AI features for investors with its acquisition of AI-powered research platform Pluto Capital, Inc. Announced on Monday, the company says that Pluto will allow Robinhood to add tools for quicker identification of trends and investment opportunities, help guide users with their investment strategies, and offer real-time portfolio optimization.\nPluto founder Jacob Sansbury will join Robinhood with the deal\u2019s closure, but terms were not disclosed.\nAt Robinhood, Sansbury will be tasked with accelerating the trading app\u2019s adoption of AI technologies. This will include using Pluto\u2019s data analysis capabilities to process and interpret market data using LLMs (large language models) that have real-time access to global financial data and users\u2019 personal data. Robinhood believes this will help its investors jump on new opportunities more quickly.\nIn addition, Pluto will help Robinhood to customize its investment strategies for the individual user by analyzing things like risk tolerance, investment goals and historical behavior for more personalized recommendations.\nInvestors will also gain real-time updates and insights thanks to Pluto\u2019s integrations, helping them to make informed decisions more quickly and optimize their portfolios for better outcomes, Robinhood claims.\nFounded in 2021, Pluto raised $4 million across multiple seed funding rounds, valuing the company at $12 million (pre-money), according to PitchBook. The startup was backed by investors including at.inc/, Switch Ventures, Caffeinated Capital and Maxime Seguineau.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Pluto and Jacob Sansbury to Robinhood,\u201d said Mayank Agarwal, VP of Engineering, in a statement shared by Robinhood. \u201cThey have built an impressive platform that is highly regarded in the financial services industry. Importantly, their expertise in artificial intelligence coupled with a mission-aligned passion to democratize finance will complement our team\u2019s effort to bring AI-powered tools to our customers,\u201d he added.\n\u201cRobinhood is the ideal destination to build products that democratize access to financial services like wealth management and financial planning through state of the art AI,\u201d said Sansbury. \u201cI look forward to innovating at the company which has inspired me and so many others,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle2:\nYouTube now lets you request removal of AI-generated content that simulates your face or voice\ndescription2:\nMeta is not the only company grappling with the rise in AI-generated content and how it affects its platform. YouTube also quietly rolled out a policy change in June that will allow people to request the takedown of AI-generated or other synthetic content that simulates their face or voice. The change allows people to request the removal of this type of AI content under YouTube\u2019s privacy request process. It\u2019s an expansion on its previously announced approach to responsible AI agenda first introduced in November.\nInstead of requesting the content be taken down for being misleading, like a deepfake, YouTube wants the affected parties to request the content\u2019s removal directly as a privacy violation. According to YouTube\u2019s recently updated Help documentation on the topic, it requires first-party claims outside a handful of exceptions, like when the affected individual is a minor, doesn\u2019t have access to a computer, is deceased or other such exceptions.\nSimply submitting the request for a takedown doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the content will be removed, however. YouTube cautions that it will make its own judgment about the complaint based on a variety of factors.\nFor instance, it may consider if the content is disclosed as being synthetic or made with AI, whether it uniquely identifies a person and whether the content could be considered parody, satire or something else of value and in the public\u2019s interest. The company additionally notes that it may consider whether the AI content features a public figure or other well-known individual, and whether or not it shows them engaging in \u201csensitive behavior\u201d like criminal activity, violence or endorsing a product or political candidate. The latter is particularly concerning in an election year, where AI-generated endorsements could potentially swing votes.\nYouTube says it will also give the content\u2019s uploader 48 hours to act on the complaint. If the content is removed before that time has passed, the complaint is closed. Otherwise, YouTube will initiate a review. The company also warns users that removal means fully removing the video from the site and, if applicable, removing the individual\u2019s name and personal information from the title, description and tags of the video, as well. Users can also blur out the faces of people in their videos, but they can\u2019t simply make the video private to comply with the removal request, as the video could be set back to public status at any time.\nThe company didn\u2019t broadly advertise the change in policy, though in March it introduced a tool in Creator Studio that allowed creators to disclose when realistic-looking content was made with altered or synthetic media, including generative AI. It also more recently began a test of a feature that would allow users to add crowdsourced notes that provide additional context on videos, like whether it\u2019s meant to be a parody or if it\u2019s misleading in some way.\nYouTube is not against the use of AI, having already experimented with generative AI itself, including with a comments summarizer and conversational tool for asking questions about a video or getting recommendations. However, the company has previously warned that simply labeling AI content as such won\u2019t necessarily protect it from removal, as it will still have to comply with YouTube\u2019s Community Guidelines.\nIn the case of privacy complaints over AI material, YouTube won\u2019t jump to penalize the original content creator.\n\u201cFor creators, if you receive notice of a privacy complaint, keep in mind that privacy violations are separate from Community Guidelines strikes and receiving a privacy complaint will not automatically result in a strike,\u201d a company representative last month shared on the YouTube Community site where the company updates creators directly on new policies and features.\nIn other words, YouTube\u2019s Privacy Guidelines are different from its Community Guidelines, and some content may be removed from YouTube as the result of a privacy request even if it does not violate the Community Guidelines. While the company won\u2019t apply a penalty, like an upload restriction, when a creator\u2019s video is removed following a privacy complaint, YouTube tells us it may take action against accounts with repeated violations.\nUpdated, 7/1/24, 4:17 p.m. ET with more information about the actions YouTube may take for privacy violations.\n\ntitle3:\nSupreme Court sends Texas and Florida social media regulation laws back to lower courts\ndescription3:\nThe Supreme Court on Monday vacated two judicial decisions concerning Republican-backed laws from Florida and Texas aimed at limiting social media companies\u2019 ability to moderate content on their platforms.\nThe Supreme Court is sending both cases back to the lower courts for further review, noting that lower courts had failed to properly analyze the First Amendment challenges to the laws.\n\u201cThe question in such a case is whether a law\u2019s unconstitutional applications are substantial compared to its constitutional ones,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the decision. \u201cTo make that judgment, a court must determine a law\u2019s full set of applications, evaluate which are constitutional and which are not, and compare the one to the other. Neither court performed that necessary inquiry.\u201d\nBoth of the laws were adopted in 2021 and aimed to address complaints from conservatives who believed that social media companies like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) were illegally censoring conservative political views. The concerns were heightened when Facebook and X suspended former president Donald Trump\u2019s accounts following the January 6 attack on the Capitol building.\nThe laws aimed to block social media companies from removing certain political posts or accounts. The cases had the potential to determine whether social media companies should be able to determine how to moderate hate speech, election misinformation and spam on their own platforms.\nNetChoice, a lobbying group for the tech industry, sued to overturn the laws, arguing that they violated the social media platforms\u2019 speech rights. The group argued that the laws grant the government too much power over content published on privately owned social media platforms.\nLower courts ruled differently on the laws, as key measures of Florida\u2019s law were blocked while the Texas law was upheld. However, neither law has gone into effect and both laws were put on hold pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle invests in BlackRock-backed solar developer in Taiwan amid AI boom\ndescription4:\nThe aerial view reveals the mutual benefits of combining solar energy production and agricultural land use. Farmers can lease their land to solar energy developers, diversifying their income streams while maintaining agricultural activities on the remaining areas. This symbiotic relationship supports sustainable development by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy adoption.\nGoogle will partner with BlackRock to develop a 1-gigawatt pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan, the U.S. tech giant announced Monday in a press release as it seeks to boost energy capacity and cut carbon emissions amid the artificial intelligence boom.\nThe deal will see Google make a capital investment, yet to be approved by regulators, in Taiwanese solar developer New Green Power \"to facilitate the buildout of its large-scale solar pipeline.\"\nGoogle did not reveal how much it was investing into New Green Power, a BlackRock portfolio firm.\nThe investment will boost clean energy on Taiwan's local electricity grid and help Google reach its goal of achieving net-zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030, the company said.\nThe new solar capacity will help power Google's data centers and cloud region in Taiwan, the press release said. Some of the clean energy capacity will also be offered to Google's chip suppliers and manufacturers in the region, it said.\n\"We expect to procure up to 300 [megawatts] of solar energy from this pipeline through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the associated energy attribute certificates (Taiwan Renewable Energy Certificates or T-RECS) to help meet electricity demand from our data center campus, cloud region and office operations in Taiwan,\" Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google, said in a blog post on Monday.\nTaiwan produces nearly 60% of the world's semiconductor chips and accounts for an even bigger share of advanced AI processors, according to global consulting firm EY. Chip fabrication facilities are among the most energy-intensive facilities in the world as chip manufacturing is a long and complex process.\"\n\nResponse:",
