Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The feature, which OpenAI showed off at its GPT-4o launch event in May, was criticized for sounding similar to Scarlett Johansson and was later delayed for safety reasons.\nAt OpenAI\u2019s event, the new voice mode appeared to be noticeably more capable than ChatGPT\u2019s current voice mode. Onstage, OpenAI employees were able to interrupt and ask the chatbot to tell a story in different ways, and the chatbot took their interruptions in stride to adjust its responses.\nThe advanced mode was set to release in alpha in late June, but OpenAI delayed the rollout by one month to \u201creach our bar to launch.\u201d As part of that delay, the company said it was \u201cimproving the model\u2019s ability to detect and refuse certain content.\u201d OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson says the company tested the voice model\u2019s capabilities with more than 100 external red teamers (people who try to attack technologies to find weaknesses). The company has recently faced a lot of scrutiny about its safety policies, so this pause may have been the right choice. OpenAI has also \u201cadded new filters that will recognize and block certain requests to generate music or other copyrighted audio,\u201d Christianson says.\nDuring OpenAI\u2019s event, one of the key criticisms of the new mode was how much the onstage voice, dubbed \u201cSky,\u201d sounded like Johansson, who played an AI personality in the movie Her. While the voice had been in ChatGPT before OpenAI\u2019s spring demo, the company pulled it shortly before Johansson revealed she had sent letters to OpenAI asking how the voice was made. Christianson says that ChatGPT\u2019s new mode will only use four preset voices it made with voice actors, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve made it so that ChatGPT cannot impersonate other people\u2019s voices, both individuals and public figures, and will block outputs that differ from one of these preset voices.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nAMD is becoming an AI chip company, just like Nvidia\ndescription1:\nAMD just announced its second quarter 2024 earnings today, and the highlight was this: nearly half the company\u2019s sales are now data center products \u2014 not chips for personal computers, not game consoles, not embedded chips for industry or vehicles.\nThe company\u2019s data center business has doubled in a single year, and this quarter\u2019s growth was primarily due to a single chip: the AMD Instinct MI300 accelerator, which competes with Nvidia\u2019s infamously influential H100 AI chip. The AMD chip just did over $1 billion in sales in a single quarter, according to CEO Lisa Su, up from its previous milestone of $1 billion cumulatively since its December 2023 debut. (AMD says its Epyc server CPUs also contributed.)\nAMD\u2019s earnings by segment: clock that 115 percent rise in data center. Image: AMD\nIt looks like AMD is following a similar path to Nvidia itself, which has profited so phenomenally from the Nvidia H100 that it will now make new AI chips every year, accelerating all of its research and development to stay ahead, focusing its business on the product that\u2019s so popular it can\u2019t keep on shelves.\nAMD, too, plans to release new AI chips every year: it has the MI325X coming in the fourth quarter of this year, the MI350 in 2025, and it plans to have the MI400 in 2026, the company reiterated today on its earnings call. Su said the MI350 should be \u201cvery competitive\u201d with Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell, which it revealed this March as \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful chip\u201d for AI and recently began sampling to buyers.\nAs far as today\u2019s MI300, Su says she\u2019s still selling as many as AMD can make. Despite supply chain improvements, \u201csupply will remain tight through 2025.\u201d\nNvidia has a tremendous headstart over AMD, and despite doubling this year, AMD\u2019s data center business is a tiny fraction of the size of Nvidia\u2019s \u2014 $2.8 billion in a quarter vs. $22.6 billion in a quarter for Nvidia, which also just had record results in data center.\nWhat does all this mean for PC gamers and others looking for new chips? It could be that the rising tide raises all boats \u2014 each new GPU architecture, funded by AI dollars, could be handed down for other tasks, yielding faster improvements than before. But in 2024, at least, the AI fervor seems to mean no new GPUs for gamers.\nThat said, AMD\u2019s personal computing CPU and GPU businesses were up, not down, this past quarter. Ryzen CPUs were up 49 percent year over year and slightly up quarter over quarter, and while flagging PlayStation and Xbox sales made gaming revenue decline 59 percent, AMD said its Radeon 6000 GPUs actually increased sales year over year.\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft Q4 2024: cloud rules as Surface dips\ndescription2:\nMicrosoft just posted the fourth and final quarter of its 2024 fiscal financial results. The software maker made $64.7 billion in revenue and a net income of $22 billion during Q4. Revenue is up 15 percent, and net income has increased by 10 percent.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud revenues, which include the company\u2019s server products and cloud services, were $28.5 billion overall and up 19 percent year over year. Revenues from this part of Microsoft\u2019s business now make up nearly 45 percent of all revenue. While cloud revenue is strong once again, Microsoft\u2019s consumer devices push continues to dip. Xbox hardware revenue is down again, and Surface revenue has now declined for seven consecutive quarters in a row.\nMicrosoft\u2019s new Qualcomm-powered Surface devices. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\nWindows and Surface revenue\nWindows OEM revenue, the price that manufacturers pay to license Windows for laptops and PCs, is up 4 percent year over year. Gartner said earlier this month that PC shipments had grown for three consecutive quarters, and that\u2019s reflected in Microsoft\u2019s Windows OEM growing in the same three quarters.\nMicrosoft also launched its new Copilot Plus PCs toward the end of fiscal Q4, with a variety of Qualcomm-powered devices available from June 18th onwards. Two new Surface devices, the Surface Laptop 7th Edition and Surface Pro 11th Edition, also launched in June. The full impact of sales on devices revenue won\u2019t be felt until next quarter, though.\nThat means Surface revenue, or what Microsoft now calls devices revenue, has declined again this quarter by 11 percent. The last time Microsoft\u2019s Surface revenue was up was in Q1 FY23, the quarter ended September 30th, 2022.\nMicrosoft switched up its hardware portfolio amid layoffs in early 2023, and the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 for businesses don\u2019t seem to have had a big impact on revenues. All eyes are on next quarter to see if the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro launches have helped devices revenue recover at all.\nMicrosoft CFO Amy Hood says the company\u2019s devices revenue will continue to decline next quarter, in low to mid single digits. Windows OEM revenue should be relatively flat next quarter \u201cin line with the PC market,\u201d according to Hood.\nA white discless Xbox Series X is coming later this year. Image: Microsoft\nXbox and gaming\nXbox content and services revenue, which includes Xbox Game Pass, is up by 61 percent this quarter. Activision Blizzard revenues have once again contributed to the majority of revenue here, with 58 points of net impact. Without Activision Blizzard revenues, Xbox content and services revenue will still have been up 3 percent year over year.\nMicrosoft revealed in February that Xbox Game Pass has now grown to 34 million subscribers, including the Xbox Game Pass Core (previously Xbox Live Gold) members. Microsoft is planning to launch a new Xbox Game Pass Standard plan soon, which is designed to replace the Xbox Game Pass for Console offering for new subscribers.\nMicrosoft just launched last year\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III on Xbox Game Pass, and it\u2019s also planning to make Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the next installment in Activision\u2019s popular franchise, available on Xbox Game Pass later this year.\nMicrosoft\u2019s price hikes for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass don\u2019t come into effect until September, with Game Pass Ultimate increasing to $19.99 a month \u2014 a $3 increase over the current $16.99 a month pricing. PC Game Pass is also moving up to $11.99 a month in September.\nSign up for Notepad by Tom Warren, a weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft\u2019s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.

Xbox hardware revenue is down a massive 42 percent this quarter. Microsoft is planning to launch a discless Xbox Series X console in white later this year, alongside a new Galaxy Black special edition Xbox Series X.\nMicrosoft has also been focusing on the message of \u201cno Xbox required\u201d for its cloud streaming efforts recently. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox TV app recently arrived on some Amazon Fire TV devices, as Microsoft turns it attention away from just marketing console hardware.\nDespite the poor Xbox hardware revenue, gaming revenue at Microsoft is up 44 percent overall, helped again by the additional Activision Blizzard revenue. In fact, that revenue added 48 points, so overall gaming revenue at Microsoft would have been down 4 percent if the company hadn\u2019t acquired Activision Blizzard.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t updating its Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers this quarter, but the company did share a metric around active gaming users. \u201cWe now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on an earnings call. \u201cOur content pipeline has never been stronger.\u201d\nNext quarter, Microsoft is expecting Xbox content and services revenue to increase in the \u201clow to mid 50s,\u201d according to Hood. Overall gaming revenue will also increase in the mid 30s, with 40 points from Activision Blizzard. Hood says Xbox hardware revenue will \u201cagain decline year over year.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s cloud businesses are doing well. Image: Microsoft\nMicrosoft\u2019s cloud and Office revenues continue to grow in Q4 2024, as expected. Office commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 12 percent, with Office 365 commercial revenue up 13 percent.\nOn the Office consumer side, revenue is up 3 percent year over year. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers also grew by 10 percent, up to 82.5 million now. LinkedIn revenue also grew 10 percent this quarter.\nServer products and cloud services revenue jumped by 21 percent this quarter, with Azure and other cloud services revenue up by 29 percent. Analysts had expected more Azure revenue though, so Microsoft\u2019s stock took a hit in after-hour trading on the NASDAQ.\nInvestors are also continuing to hunt down any signs of revenue growth in AI from Microsoft. This quarter, eight points of the Azure and other cloud services revenue growth is down to AI services, up slightly from the contribution in the previous quarter.\nHood says AI is growing faster than total Azure revenue, and Microsoft is expecting the second half of its 2025 fiscal year to see additional Azure growth thanks to infrastructure investments and demand. In Q1 2025, Hood is anticipating around 28-29 percent of Azure revenue growth.\nMicrosoft is also giving employees a one-time \u201ccash award.\u201d Microsoft employees are getting an extra bonus that will work out to between 10-25 percent of the value of their regular annual bonus, according to an internal memo seen by The Verge.\n\ntitle3:\nAlphabet partnership with AI firm Anthropic probed by UK regulator\ndescription3:\nIn this photo illustration, the Alphabet Inc. logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen and the Google logo in the background. Jaque Silva | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nBritain's competition regulator on Tuesday said it is investigating to see if Google parent Alphabet's partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has resulted in reduced competition. The Competition and Markets Authority said that it is looking into whether a partnership between the two firms has led to a \"relevant merger situation,\" and if that \"may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition\" in the U.K. The regulator has invited comments from interested parties before beginning a formal investigation. An Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC that the company will cooperate with the CMA and \"provide them with the complete picture about Google's investment and our commercial collaboration.\" \"We are an independent company and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,\" the spokesperson added.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson added that, unlike OpenAI, which previously gave Microsoft an observer seat on its board, neither Google nor Amazon has a seat or any observation rights over Anthropic's board. Microsoft recently dropped its seat as an observer on the board of the company. Anthropic added that its models are available non-exclusively on Google's Vertex AI platform, as well as Amazon's Bedrock, alongside models from other AI labs. Google also pushed back on competition concerns over its deal with Anthropic. A spokesperson for the company told CNBC that it's \"committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world,\" and added that Anthropic is \"free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don't demand exclusive tech rights.\" Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic back in October, in a move that involved a $500 million upfront cash injection and an additional $1.5 billion to be poured in over time. This was on top of prior investments Google had made in the company, which has reportedly given it around a 10% stake in the AI startup. Anthropic is the developer of Claude, a rival chatbot to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta to pay $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition and photo tags\ndescription4:\nTexas announced a massive settlement with Meta over the use of facial recognition on Facebook, resolving a lawsuit filed in 2022 claiming that the \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d feature on photos uploaded to Facebook violated the state\u2019s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier (CUBI) Act and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Meta has agreed to pay $1.4 billion over five years to settle the suit, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office said today.\nIt\u2019s the largest settlement ever resulting from an action brought by a single state, according to Paxton. It\u2019s also the first lawsuit and settlement under CUBI and serves as a warning to other companies in violation of the state\u2019s privacy rights, he says.\n\u201cAny abuse of Texans\u2019 sensitive data will be met with the full force of the law,\u201d Paxton said in a press release.\nAt issue are suggestions Facebook made for tagging people on photos. \u201cIn 2011, Meta rolled out a new feature, initially called Tag Suggestions, that it claimed would improve the user experience by making it easier for users to \u2018tag\u2019 photographs with the names of people in the photo,\u201d according to the press release.\nThat was two years after Texas passed the CUBI Act, which prohibits companies from capturing biometric data like face geometry without receiving prior informed consent. Facebook turned on tag suggestions automatically \u2014 \u201ccapturing and using the personal biometric data of millions of Texans without the authorization required by law,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office says.\nThe suit initially sought $25,000 in civil penalties per CUBI violation plus an added $10,000 per violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, The Verge previously reported. Those penalties could have reached hundreds of billions of dollars, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2022.\nThe company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement. In 2017, Facebook introduced an \u201con/off\u201d control for tag suggestions, which it replaced with broader facial recognition settings in 2019.
