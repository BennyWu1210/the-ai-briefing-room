Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday July 17), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nElon Musk vows to move X, SpaceX headquarters from California to Texas\ndescription0:\nElon Musk is doubling down on his commitment to Texas by vowing to move SpaceX\u2019s massive headquarters from its long-time Hawthorne, California home to the Lone Star State.\nMusk later said that he would move the headquarters of his social media platform X from San Francisco, California, to Austin, Texas \u2014 where his other company, Tesla, is headquartered. SpaceX will be headquartered in Starbase, where the company operates a massive Starship manufacturing and testing site.\n\u201cHave had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building,\u201d he posted on X. Regarding the SpaceX move, Musk said \u201cthe final straw\u201d was the passage of a California bill signed this week by Governor Gavin Newsom that prohibits schools from creating or enforcing policies that would require employees to disclose students\u2019 sexuality or gender identity to anyone without their consent \u2014 like parents. Musk said this law, \u201cand the many others that precede it,\u201d attack \u201cboth families and companies.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s declaration has precedent. Tesla announced it would move its headquarters from California to Austin, Texas back in 2021 \u2014 although the automaker still has a sizable footprint in the Golden state, including its assembly plant in Fremont.\nMusk has already tied his companies to the Lone Star State in other ways, too: SpaceX officially changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in February, a move that was a response to a ruling from a Delaware judge over Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation package for his role as chief executive at Tesla. The same month, Musk also moved his brain implant company from Delaware to Nevada. Last month, Tesla shareholders voted not only to re-approve the massive pay package but also to reincorporate the company from Delaware to Texas.\nSpaceX moved into former Northrop Corporation plant in 2007, a complex that has grown to more than 1 million square feet. Southern California has historically been a major aerospace hub, and that identity is true today, with companies ranging from massive primes like Boeing to dozens of startups finding their home in Los Angeles County.\nX, which was formerly Twitter, has had its headquarters in San Francisco after being founded there in 2006.\nThe larger ramifications of the proposed move for both companies are unclear. For SpaceX, Hawthorne is not just its headquarters but also home to large production facilities for its Falcon rocket and Dragon spacecraft, as well as mission control. But if SpaceX and X follow the path of Tesla, it\u2019s likely that much of the status quo will remain the same.\nRegardless, Texas Governor Greg Abbott applauded Musk\u2019s statement, saying that it cements his state\u2019s status as \u201cthe leader in space exploration.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft faces UK antitrust probe after hiring Inflection AI founders and employees\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft is facing a full regulatory probe in the U.K. after the tech giant hired the core team behind Inflection AI, a U.S.-based OpenAI rival in which Microsoft had previously invested.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) today announced that it\u2019s launching a \u201cphase 1\u201d merger inquiry, which kicks off a 40-working day investigative period where it will gather evidence and decide whether to proceed with a full probe.\nThe news comes four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella launched a new consumer AI division spearheaded by the founders of Inflection AI, including deep learning scientist Kar\u00e9n Simonyan and Google DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. At the same time, Nadella confirmed that a number of other Inflection AI members had joined Microsoft\u2019s new AI unit (Bloomberg reported that most actually joined), one of whom was Jordan Hoffmann, an AI scientist and engineer who is now heading up Microsoft\u2019s U.K. AI hub in London.\nAt the heart of the concerns is that big tech companies are adopting a new M&A approach designed to circumvent regulatory scrutiny around AI, in what some have dubbed the \u201cquasi-merger,\u201d which may involve anything from strategic investments to scooping up startup founders and technical talent.\nMulti-pronged investigations\nToday\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t come as a massive surprise, as the CMA revealed in April that it was conducting preliminary enquiries into a triumvirate of AI partnerships. One of those was Microsoft\u2019s recent investment in Mistral AI, a French startup (and double unicorn) working on AI foundation models. It didn\u2019t take long for the CMA to conclude that the investment didn\u2019t qualify for investigation under current merger regulations, given that Microsoft\u2019s stake of less than 1% wouldn\u2019t give the tech giant any meaningful clout in the future direction of the startup.\nThe CMA is also currently looking at Amazon\u2019s $4 billion investment in U.S.-based AI company Anthropic, while it is also expected to launch a full probe into Microsoft\u2019s close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, similar to the European Commission in the EU.\nWith the phase 1 inquiry now under way, the CMA has until September 11 to reach a decision on whether the hiring is tantamount to a \u201cmerger,\u201d and if it is, whether it\u2019s likely to damage competition in the United Kingdom. If the CMA decides that it does, it will then proceed the case to a more in-depth \u201cphase 2\u201d probe which can take around six months.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon's Prime Day causes worker injuries, Senate probe finds\ndescription2:\nAn Amazon worker pulls a cart of packages for delivery on in New York City, July 12, 2022.\nAmazon Prime Day, the 48-hour discount blitz that kicks off Tuesday, is a \"major\" cause of worker injuries, according to the preliminary results of a Senate probe.\nThe Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, Committee on Tuesday released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse working conditions just as the company holds its annual Prime Day deals event.\nAmazon provided the committee with internal data from Prime Day 2019 that showed its total injury rate, including injuries the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, was \"just under\" 45 injuries per 100 workers, which amounts to \"nearly half of the company's warehouse workers,\" the report states.\n\"Amazon continues to treat its workers as disposable and with complete contempt for their safety and wellbeing,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent who chairs the HELP committee, said in a statement. \"That is unacceptable and that has got to change.\"\nThe internal data provided by Amazon shows that its warehouses have been understaffed during Prime Day and the holiday shopping seasons, \"endangering workers who have to manage increased volume without increased support,\" according to the report. The report cites an internal Amazon document, titled \"2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,\" which states that the company \"met only 71.2 percent of its hiring target,\" between May and June of 2021, ending the week of that year's Prime Day event.\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the report ignores the progress Amazon has made.\n\"It draws sweeping and inaccurate conclusions based on unverified anecdotes, and it misrepresents documents that are several years old and contained factual errors and faulty analysis,\" Nantel said. \"For example, one of the false claims in the report implies that we're not adequately staffed for busy shopping periods.\"\nNantel added that, since 2019, Amazon has reduced its incident rate for anything requiring more than basic first aid by 28% in the U.S. and lost time incident rate, which includes more significant injuries requiring an employee to miss at least one day of work, by 75%.\nAmazon has faced scrutiny in recent years over its workplace injury record and its treatment of warehouse and delivery workers. It's been cited by federal regulators for safety violations. OSHA and the U.S. Attorney's Office are investigating conditions at several warehouses, while the U.S. Department of Justice is examining whether Amazon underreports injuries.\nThe company said in March that its injury rates have improved. Amazon in March also announced plans to invest more than $750 million in safety initiatives this year. It has also appealed a string of citations issued by OSHA around safety hazards and violations.\nAmazon has said it's begun to automate some tasks and is also rolling out more robotic systems in warehouse facilities that the company says can improve safety, although that prospect has been debated.\n\ntitle3:\nAndreessen Horowitz founders plan to donate to pro-Trump PACs\ndescription3:\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen speaks at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\nMarc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz have told employees of their venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz, that they plan to make significant donations to political action committees supporting Donald Trump's campaign for president, CNBC has confirmed.\nThe Information first reported on the expected donations, which are based on Trump's planned tech agenda.\nThe prominent investors join others in tech who have donated to support Trump. Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and crypto billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss contributed to America PAC, which was formed recently. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also reportedly said he is planning to pledge about $45 million a month to the super PAC. And venture capitalist David Sacks, who spoke at the opening night of the Republican National Convention on Monday, co-hosted a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco.\nAndreessen Horowitz, founded in 2009, has backed companies including OpenAI, Facebook, Airbnb, Anduril, Box, DoorDash and GitHub.\nThe firm's founders haven't made formal endorsements ahead of the 2024 election. Andreessen has long been critical of what he views as Silicon Valley's left-leaning tendencies, but he did voice his support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, tweeting \"I'm with her.\"\n\u2014 CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons contributed to this report.\n\ntitle4:\nNeuralink rival Synchron is using OpenAI models to power chat feature\ndescription4:\nMark using Synchron's BCI Courtesy: Synchron\nA 64-year-old named Mark has spent the last year learning how to control devices like his laptop and phone using a brain implant. And thanks to OpenAI, it's gotten a whole lot easier to do. The neurotech startup Synchron said Thursday it's using OpenAI's latest artificial intelligence models to build a new generative chat feature for patients with its brain-computer interface, or BCI. A BCI system decodes brain signals and translates them into commands for external technologies. Synchron's model is designed to help people with paralysis communicate and maintain some independence by controlling smartphones, computers and other devices with their thoughts. The new AI chat feature can take in inputs from text, audio and images and generate prompts patients can use while texting, Synchron said. By doing so, the company said it will be able to help people like Mark engage with the outside world more efficiently and naturally. Mark, who asked CNBC not to use his last name for privacy reasons, was implanted with Synchron's BCI in August 2023. He has the degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which causes patients to gradually lose control of their muscles. He said his diagnosis in January 2021 was like \"a punch to the gut,\" though the progression of the disease has been relatively slow in his case. Mark struggles to move his shoulders, arms and hands, but can still speak and walk short distances. Eventually, he will lose those functionalities too, he said. \"There's very little, unfortunately, we can do. It's 100% fatal,\" Mark told CNBC in an interview on Monday. \"But I knew initially that I wanted to get involved in whatever I could to help future individuals with this disease.\"\nH/O: Synchron's AI-Powered chat feature Courtesy: Synchron\nMark has been testing Synchron's new chat feature intermittently over the last two months. He said it's been helping him save valuable time and energy while texting. Using a BCI requires focus and practice, so Mark said the AI helps take some of the pressure off when responding to messages. \"You get choices of how you might respond in several different ways,\" he said. \"So rather than me typing single words, I'm hitting one or two buttons or clicks, if you will, and I've got the majority of a sentence done.\" For instance, Mark can use the chat feature to schedule an appointment with his doctor and keep up with his daughters. He spent more than two decades in the floral industry and said he recently used the tool to talk about gardening with a Synchron employee. It's a topic the two have bonded over. Synchron CEO Thomas Oxley said the company is taking a \"pragmatic view\" in selecting the models that best support its patients' needs. Right now, that role belongs to OpenAI, but Oxley said the companies are not in an exclusive partnership. Synchron does not share any brain data with OpenAI, he added. Oxley said Synchron is still working to roll out the new chat feature, but Mark has helped pioneer it. \"For him, it's a preservation of autonomy,\" Oxley told CNBC in an interview. \"The most important function of BCI is to preserve his ability to make choices.\" 'Something bigger than yourself'\nMark works with a Synchron employee.
