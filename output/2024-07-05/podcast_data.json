Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday July 8), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla shares wipe out loss for the year with 27% rally this week\ndescription0:\nElon Musk attends \"Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk\" during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three in Cannes, France, on June 19, 2024.\nTesla's stock price rose enough on Friday to wipe out its loss for the year and bring its gain for the week to 27%.\nShares of the electric vehicle maker closed Friday at $251.55. They ended last year at $248.48, and proceeded to fall as low as $138.80 in April.\nThe latest rally was sparked by a better-than-expected deliveries report for the second quarter on Tuesday. While deliveries still dropped 4.8% from a year earlier, the falloff was less steep than the first-quarter decline, and gave investors reasons for optimism heading into the second half.\nIn April, Tesla shares hit a 52-week low after a string of troubling developments. Sales in the core automotive business fell in the first quarter, the company downsized through sweeping layoffs and there were reports that Tesla had scrapped plans to soon produce a low-cost family car at its Texas factory.\nTesla is set to deliver second-quarter financial results after the bell on July 23. Automotive gross margins are likely to be in focus.\nSince last year, Tesla has been offering extensive discounts and incentives to attract customers to its aging lineup of EVs, including its popular entry-level Model 3 sedans, Model Y crossover utility vehicles and its more expensive flagship Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.\n\ntitle1:\nAI drives up earnings, shares pop\ndescription1:\nThe Samsung logo is on display at their pavilion during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on February 28, 2024. (Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nShares of Samsung Electronics jumped to their highest level since January 2021 after the South Korean tech giant said it expects better-than-expected profit for the second-quarter, thanks to explosive demand for artificial intelligence.\nThe stock climbed as much as 2.24% on Friday morning, trading at a high of 86,500 Korean won ($62.73), according to LSEG data. Samsung shares closed at 84,600 won on Thursday.\nSamsung issued guidance on Friday, saying operating profit for the April to June quarter is projected to be about 10.4 trillion won ($7.54 billion) \u2014 that's a jump of about 1,452% from 670 billion won a year ago. The expected operating profit beat a LSEG estimate of 8.51 trillion won.\nThe firm also said it expects revenue for the second quarter to be between 73 trillion to 75 trillion won, from 60.01 trillion won a year ago. This is in line with the 73.7 trillion won estimated by LSEG analysts.\nBusiness for the world's largest memory chip maker rebounded as memory chip prices recovered on AI optimism last year. The South Korean electronics giant saw record losses in 2023 as the industry reeled from a post-Covid slump in demand for memory chips and electronics.\nIts memory chips are commonly found in a wide range of consumer devices including smartphones and computers.\n\ntitle2:\nApple approves Epic Games' marketplace app after initial rejections\ndescription2:\nAfter multiple rejections, Apple has approved Fortnite maker Epic Games\u2019 third-party app marketplace for launch in the EU. As now permitted by the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Epic announced earlier this year it planned to bring both the digital storefront and its flagship game, Fortnite, back to iOS in Europe. However, on Friday, Epic Games took to X (formerly Twitter) to complain that Apple had rejected its submission twice over concerns that its Games Store looked too much like Apple\u2019s App Store. Epic then said it would take the matter to European regulators for review.\nLater in the day, Apple approved the third-party marketplace app on the condition that Epic Games would make the necessary corrections in a subsequent update.\nAccording to posts on X, Epic Games initially said Apple had rejected its submission over details like the position of its \u201cInstall\u201d button for games, which Apple said is too similar to its own \u201cGet\u201d button. It also said that it was rejected for its \u201cin-app purchase\u201d label being too much like Apple\u2019s label.\n3/3 Apple's rejection is arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA, and we've shared our concerns with the European Commission. Barring further roadblocks from Apple, we remain ready to launch in the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS in the EU in the next couple of\u2026 \u2014 Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) July 5, 2024\nEpic argued that it\u2019s using the same naming conventions that are standard across popular app stores on other platforms.\nThe company also called the rejection \u201carbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA,\u201d and said it has shared its concerns with the European Commission.\nIn the afternoon on Friday, Apple said it had approved the Epic Sweden AB Marketplace app but added the game maker would still need to make the fixes Apple requires. As per Section 2.3 (G) of Apple\u2019s developer agreement, Epic Games had agreed not to make its Games Store appear confusingly similar to the App Store, the iPhone maker said. Apple noted that Epic had generally followed this guideline, except for the design and copy of the download button.\nApple also said that Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite app has already been approved.\nEpic\u2019s case represents a high-profile example of how stringent Apple will be with the new rules that permit third-party app stores on iOS for the first time. Excessive rejections could also dissuade other developers interested in testing the waters with their own distribution channels.\nUnder the DMA\u2019s new rules, Apple is required to allow third-party app stores on the iPhone as the tech giant was deemed a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d under EU law. App developers can also switch to a set of new DMA rules that allow them to reduce commissions on in-app purchases on the App Store, though the process still involves fees under a complicated new structure that has developers paying Apple for the use of its technology instead.\nEpic has been battling Apple for years for a means of reaching its customers on the iPhone without having to pay commissions on in-app purchases. The company took the case to the courts in the U.S., where it ultimately lost on most fronts, having failed to prove Apple was a monopolist. But Epic\u2019s continued complaints saw Apple briefly terminating the game maker\u2019s developer account in the EU, before EU regulators again stepped in. Since then, Epic Games has vowed to launch Fortnite on iOS and iPad in the EU and bring its Games Store to the market.\nEpic confirmed the approval of its marketplace app on X and in an email with TechCrunch.\nUpdate: Apple has informed us that our previously rejected Epic Games Store notarization submission has now been accepted. https://t.co/tl5LY1aQD6 \u2014 Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) July 5, 2024\nUpdate, 7/5/24, 5:28 PM ET This post was updated from its original version with the latest development involving Apple\u2019s approval of Epic Games\u2019 marketplace app in the EU.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI breach is a reminder that AI companies are treasure troves for hackers\ndescription3:\nThere\u2019s no need to worry that your secret ChatGPT conversations were obtained in a recently reported breach of OpenAI\u2019s systems. The hack itself, while troubling, appears to have been superficial \u2014 but it\u2019s reminder that AI companies have in short order made themselves into one of the juiciest targets out there for hackers.\nThe New York Times reported the hack in more detail after former OpenAI employee Leopold Aschenbrenner hinted at it recently in a podcast. He called it a \u201cmajor security incident,\u201d but unnamed company sources told the Times the hacker only got access to an employee discussion forum. (I reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and comment.)\nNo security breach should really be treated as trivial, and eavesdropping on internal OpenAI development talk certainly has its value. But it\u2019s far from a hacker getting access to internal systems, models in progress, secret roadmaps, and so on.\nBut it should scare us anyway, and not necessarily because of the threat of China or other adversaries overtaking us in the AI arms race. The simple fact is that these AI companies have become gatekeepers to a tremendous amount of very valuable data.\nLet\u2019s talk about three kinds of data OpenAI and, to a lesser extent, other AI companies created or have access to: high-quality training data, bulk user interactions, and customer data.\nIt\u2019s uncertain what training data exactly they have, because the companies are incredibly secretive about their hoards. But it\u2019s a mistake to think that they are just big piles of scraped web data. Yes, they do use web scrapers or datasets like the Pile, but it\u2019s a gargantuan task shaping that raw data into something that can be used to train a model like GPT-4o. A huge amount of human work hours are required to do this \u2014 it can only be partially automated.\nSome machine learning engineers have speculated that of all the factors going into the creation of a large language model (or, perhaps, any transformer-based system), the single most important one is dataset quality. That\u2019s why a model trained on Twitter and Reddit will never be as eloquent as one trained on every published work of the last century. (And probably why OpenAI reportedly used questionably legal sources like copyrighted books in their training data, a practice they claim to have given up.)\nSo the training datasets OpenAI has built are of tremendous value to competitors, from other companies to adversary states to regulators here in the U.S. Wouldn\u2019t the FTC or courts like to know exactly what data was being used, and whether OpenAI has been truthful about that?\nBut perhaps even more valuable is OpenAI\u2019s enormous trove of user data \u2014 probably billions of conversations with ChatGPT on hundreds of thousands of topics. Just as search data was once the key to understanding the collective psyche of the web, ChatGPT has its finger on the pulse of a population that may not be as broad as the universe of Google users, but provides far more depth. (In case you weren\u2019t aware, unless you opt out, your conversations are being used for training data.)\nIn the case of Google, an uptick in searches for \u201cair conditioners\u201d tells you the market is heating up a bit. But those users don\u2019t then have a whole conversation about what they want, how much money they\u2019re willing to spend, what their home is like, manufacturers they want to avoid, and so on. You know this is valuable because Google is itself trying to convert its users to provide this very information by substituting AI interactions for searches!\nThink of how many conversations people have had with ChatGPT, and how useful that information is, not just to developers of AIs, but to marketing teams, consultants, analysts\u2026 it\u2019s a gold mine.\nThe last category of data is perhaps of the highest value on the open market: how customers are actually using AI, and the data they have themselves fed to the models.\nHundreds of major companies and countless smaller ones use tools like OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s APIs for an equally large variety of tasks. And in order for a language model to be useful to them, it usually must be fine-tuned on or otherwise given access to their own internal databases.\nThis might be something as prosaic as old budget sheets or personnel records (to make them more easily searchable, for instance) or as valuable as code for an unreleased piece of software. What they do with the AI\u2019s capabilities (and whether they\u2019re actually useful) is their business, but the simple fact is that the AI provider has privileged access, just as any other SaaS product does.\nThese are industrial secrets, and AI companies are suddenly right at the heart of a great deal of them. The newness of this side of the industry carries with it a special risk in that AI processes are simply not yet standardized or fully understood.\nLike any SaaS provider, AI companies are perfectly capable of providing industry standard levels of security, privacy, on-premises options, and generally speaking providing their service responsibly. I have no doubt that the private databases and API calls of OpenAI\u2019s Fortune 500 customers are locked down very tightly! They must certainly be as aware or more of the risks inherent in handling confidential data in the context of AI. (The fact OpenAI did not report this attack is their choice to make, but it doesn\u2019t inspire trust for a company that desperately needs it.)\nBut good security practices don\u2019t change the value of what they are meant to protect, or the fact that malicious actors and sundry adversaries are clawing at the door to get in. Security isn\u2019t just picking the right settings or keeping your software updated \u2014 though of course the basics are important too. It\u2019s a never-ending cat-and-mouse game that is, ironically, now being supercharged by AI itself: agents and attack automators are probing every nook and cranny of these companies\u2019 attack surfaces.\nThere\u2019s no reason to panic \u2014 companies with access to lots of personal or commercially valuable data have faced and managed similar risks for years. But AI companies represent a newer, younger, and potentially juicier target than your garden-variety poorly configured enterprise server or irresponsible data broker. Even a hack like the one reported above, with no serious exfiltrations that we know of, should worry anybody who does business with AI companies. They\u2019ve painted the targets on their backs. Don\u2019t be surprised when anyone, or everyone, takes a shot.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon faces more EU scrutiny over recommender algorithms and ads transparency\ndescription4:\nIn its latest step targeting a major marketplace, the European Commission sent Amazon another request for information (RFI) Friday in relation to its compliance under the bloc\u2019s rulebook for digital services.\nThe development highlights areas where EU enforcers are dialing up their scrutiny of the e-commerce giant, with the bloc asking for more info about Amazon\u2019s recommender systems, ads transparency provisions and risk assessment measures.\nAn earlier Commission RFI to Amazon, last November, focused on risk assessments and mitigations around the dissemination of illegal products; and the protection of fundamental rights, including in relation to its recommender systems. A Commission spokesperson confirmed the e-commerce giant has received three RFIs in all \u2014 following a January ask for more info on how it\u2019s providing data access for researchers.\nThe EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) puts requirements on platforms and services to abide by a series of governance standards, including in areas like content moderation. In the case of online marketplaces the law also requires they implement measures to enable them to take action to tackle risks around the sale of illegal goods. Larger marketplaces, such as Amazon, have an additional layer of algorithmic transparency and accountability obligations under the regime \u2014 and this is where the Commission RFIs are focused.\nThe additional rules have applied on Amazon since the end of August last year, following its designation by the EU as a very large online platform (VLOP) in April 2023. It\u2019s the Commission\u2019s job to enforce these extra obligations on VLOPs.\nWhile it remains to be seen if the latest Commission RFI to Amazon will lead to a formal investigation of its DSA compliance the stakes remain high for the e-commerce giant. Any confirmed violations could get very costly as penalties for breaching the pan-EU law can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover. (NB: The company\u2019s full-year revenue for 2023 was $574.8 billion, meaning \u2014 on paper at least \u2014 its regulatory risk runs into double-figure billions.)\nDetailing its action in a press release, the Commission said it has sent Amazon an RFI related to measures it has taken to comply with DSA rules related to the transparency of recommender systems and their parameters. It also said it\u2019s asking for more info about Amazon\u2019s provisions for maintaining an ad repository \u2014 another legally mandated transparency step for larger platforms.\nThe Commission also said it wants more detail about Amazon\u2019s risk assessment report. The DSA requires VLOPs to both proactively assess systemic risks that might arise on their platforms and take steps to mitigate issues. Platforms also need to document their compliance process.\n\u201cIn particular, Amazon is asked to provide detailed information on its compliance with the provisions concerning transparency of the recommender systems, the input factors, features, signals, information and metadata applied for such systems and options offered to users to opt out of being profiled for the recommender systems,\u201d the EU wrote. \u201cThe company also has to provide more information on the design, development, deployment, testing and maintenance of the online interface of Amazon Store\u2019s Ad Library and supporting documents regarding its risk assessment report.\u201d\nThe EU has given Amazon until July 26 to provide the requested info. After that, any next steps will depend on its assessment of its response. But failure to respond satisfactorily to an RFI could itself trigger a sanction.\nLast year the EU named online marketplaces as one of a handful of priority issues for its enforcement of the DSA\u2019s rules for VLOPs. And it has looked attentive to the area.\nLate last month it sent separate RFIs to rival marketplace VLOPs, Shein and Temu \u2014 soon after designating the pair. Although, in their case, the Commission\u2019s RFIs also raised concern about illegal goods risks and manipulative design (including as a potential child safety risk), as well as asking them for more information about the operation of their own recommender systems.\nWhy so much interest here? Algorithmic sorting has the power to influence platform users\u2019 whole experience by determining the content and/or products they see.\nIn a nutshell, the EU wants the DSA to crack open such blackbox AI systems to ensure that platforms\u2019 commercial agendas \u2014 to grab users\u2019 attention and/or drive more sales \u2014 aren\u2019t the only thing programming these automated decisions. It therefore wants the DSA to act as a shield against the risks of AI-driven societal harms, such as platforms pushing content that\u2019s harmful for people\u2019s mental health or recommending shoppers buy dangerous products. But achieving that goal will require enforcement.\nAmazon, meanwhile, is unhappy about the EU regime. Last year it challenged its DSA designation as a VLOP. And last fall it won an interim stay on one element of VLOPs\u2019 DSA compliance \u2014 namely the requirement to publish an ads library. However, in March, the EU General Court reversed the earlier decision, overturning the partial suspension.\n\u201cFollowing its designation as a Very Large Online Platform and the Court\u2019s decision to reject Amazon\u2019s request to suspend the obligation to make its advertisement repository publicly available, Amazon is required to comply with the full set of DSA obligations,\u201d the Commission wrote today. \u201cThis includes diligently identifying and assessing all systemic risks relevant to its service, providing an option in their recommender systems that is not based on user profiling, and have an advertisement repository publicly available.\u201d\nGiven Amazon has spent money on lawyers to try to argue why it shouldn\u2019t have to comply with the DSA ads library element \u2014 and the subsequent overturning of the stay \u2014 it\u2019s not too surprising this is one of the areas where the Commission is seeking more information now.\nThe EU was contacted with questions. A Commission spokesperson confirmed the first RFI to Amazon, from November 2023, had \u201ca strong focus on the dissemination of illegal products and the protection of fundamental rights online\u201d, as well as asking questions about its recommender systems.\nA second RFI, in January 2024, focused on measures Amazon has taken to comply with data access for eligible researchers, per the spokesperson. They said the latest RFI is strongly focused on measures taken to meet DSA obligations related to the transparency of recommender systems and their parameters, as well as to the provisions on maintaining an ad repository.\n\u201cThese are actually different areas we are looking into,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cYou are however right to say that today\u2019s RFI also follows the Court\u2019s decision to reject Amazon\u2019s request to suspend the obligation to make its advertisement repository publicly available.\u201d\nWe also reached out to Amazon for a response to the Commission\u2019s RFI.\nA company spokesperson emailed TechCrunch this statement: \u201cWe are reviewing this request and working closely with the European Commission. Amazon shares the goal of the European Commission to create a safe, predictable and trusted shopping environment. We think this is important for all participants in the retail industry, and we invest significantly in protecting our store from bad actors, illegal content, and in creating a trustworthy shopping experience. We have built on this strong foundation for DSA compliance.\u201d\nThis report was updated with responses from the Commission\"\n\nResponse:",
