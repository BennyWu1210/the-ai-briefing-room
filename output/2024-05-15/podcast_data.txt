Dell stock surges on optimism it has big AI server orders
description0:
Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, is speaking at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, on February 27, 2024.
Dell shares rose more than 11% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.
Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.
"All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM," Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the company's fiscal 2025 — ending next February.
Wednesday's move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.
Dell shares are now up over 99% in 2024, trailing the 233% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprise 's 6% gains this year.
Most AI servers are built around Nvidia's chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google , OpenAI and Meta . Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.
At Nvidia 's annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.
"You're going to need an AI factory," Huang said. "And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell."
"Michael [Dell] is here and he's happy to take your order," Huang continued.
"While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates," Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dell's business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dell's market share increasing.
He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and "attach" additional hardware, such as data storage.
Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.
Dell's other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.
PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.
But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.
"We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months," Woodring wrote.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever says he will leave the startup
description1:
Sam Altman (L), US entrepreneur, investor, programmer, and founder and CEO of artificial intelligence company OpenAI, and the company's co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, speak together at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv on June 5, 2023.
OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever said Tuesday that he's leaving the Microsoft -backed startup.
"I am excited for what comes next — a project that is very personally meaningful to me about which I will share details in due time," Sutskever wrote in an X post on Tuesday.
The departure comes months after OpenAI went through a leadership crisis involving co-founder and CEO Sam Altman.
In November, OpenAI's board said in a statement that Altman had not been "consistently candid in his communications with the board." The issue quickly came to look more complex. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that artificial intelligence would not harm humans, while others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.
Almost all of OpenAI's employees signed an open letter saying they would leave in response to the board's action. Days later, Altman was back at the company, and board members Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley and Sutskever, who had voted to oust Altman, were out. Adam D'Angelo, who had also voted to push out Altman, stayed on the board.
When Altman was asked about Sutskever's status on a Zoom call with reporters at the time, he said there were no updates to share. "I love Ilya. ... I hope we work together for the rest of our careers, my career, whatever," Altman said. "Nothing to announce today."
On Tuesday, Altman shared his thoughts on Sutskever's departure.
"This is very sad to me; Ilya is easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend," Altman wrote on X. "His brilliance and vision are well known; his warmth and compassion are less well known but no less important." Altman said research director Jakub Pachocki, who has been at OpenAI since 2017, will replace Sutskever as chief scientist.
OpenAI has announced new board members, including former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Microsoft obtained a nonvoting board observer position.
In March, OpenAI announced its new board and the wrap-up of an internal investigation by U.S. law firm WilmerHale into the events leading up to Altman's ouster. Altman rejoined OpenAI's board, and three new board members were announced: Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Nicole Seligman, former EVP and global general counsel of Sony and president of Sony Entertainment; and Fidji Simo, CEO and chair of Instacart.
The three new members will "work closely with current board members Adam D'Angelo, Larry Summers and Bret Taylor as well as Greg, Sam, and OpenAI's senior management," according to a company release in March, referencing OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman.
News of Sutskever's departure comes a day after OpenAI launched a new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT, along with an updated user interface, the company's latest effort to expand use of its popular chatbot.
The update brings the GPT-4 model to everyone, including OpenAI's free users, technology chief Mira Murati said Monday in a livestreamed event. She added that the new model, GPT-4o, is "much faster," with improved capabilities in text, video and audio.
OpenAI said it eventually plans to allow users to video chat with ChatGPT. "This is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use," Murati said.
In 2015, Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, another OpenAI co-founder, wanted Sutskever, then a research scientist at Google , to become the budding startup's top scientist, according to the lawsuit Musk filed against OpenAI in March.
"Dr. Sutskever went back and forth on whether to leave Google and join the project, but it was ultimately a call from Mr. Musk on the day OpenAI, Inc. was publicly announced that convinced Dr. Sutskever to commit to joining the project as OpenAI, Inc.'s Chief Scientist," the legal filing said.
Jan Leike, who had been co-leader with Sutskever of OpenAI's Superalignment team, also said on X on Tuesday that he has left the startup.
The team, announced last year, has been working to achieve "scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us." OpenAI committed 20% of its computing power to the initiative over four years.

Palo Alto Networks will buy IBM QRadar cloud security software assets
description2:
Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, appears on CNBC's "Squawk Box" at the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 16th, 2024.
Palo Alto Networks is buying cloud security software assets from IBM as part of a broader partnership that will give the cybersecurity company access to more consultants and a bigger customer base.
In a joint press release, the companies said Palo Alto is acquiring IBM's QRadar cloud software for an undisclosed sum and migrating existing customers to its security platform, Cortex Xsiam. The move normally takes one to three months, Nikesh Arora, Palo Alto's CEO, told CNBC. Also, IBM will train more than 1,000 of its consulting employees on Palo Alto's products.
Consolidation has been ramping up in the security software industry as companies gear up for a swarm of attacks spawned by artificial intelligence. In March, Cisco closed its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, the networking company's largest deal ever, snapping up the leading provider of security information and event management (SIEM) software.
Earlier on Wednesday, two other companies in the SIEM market, Exabeam and Thoma Bravo's LogRhythm, announced plans to merge.
Arora said his company needs to be better prepared to go up against Splunk.
"Clearly, it's just a hotbed of activity in the consolidation in cybersecurity," Arora said.
Palo Alto and IBM have been working more closely together for months, and Arora said he'd been talking with IBM CEO Arvind Krishna about how to advance their partnership. But they both sold SIEM software.
"We used to get stuck there," Arora said.
Krishna said the Splunk deal didn't push IBM to make its arrangements with Palo Alto.
"We don't really compete, I think, with most things in Cisco's portfolio," Krishna said.
In December, IBM said its consulting group would offer Palo Alto's competing Cortex Xsiam software to customers. IBM will now adopt Cortex Xsiam, as well as Palo Alto's Prisma Sase 3.0 product bundle. Palo Alto will incorporate IBM's Watsonx large language models into Cortex Xsiam, in addition to its use of models from Google .
The SIEM category has been around for over 20 years, but Palo Alto just introduced Cortex Xsiam two years ago. It's rapidly gained adoption, with over $90 million in bookings in the latest quarter, and Arora said the company has been taking market share from "everyone."
For IBM, a more robust lineup of contemporary security tools for consulting might help the company deliver on its stated goal of revenue growth in the mid-single digits for 2024. In the first quarter, revenue increased 3%, with a 2% bump in the consulting segment.
Palo Alto is growing much faster than IBM. In the January quarter, revenue jumped 19%. The company will report results for the latest quarter on Monday.
Palo Alto more than doubled in value last year and its stock is up 6% year to date, lifting the company's market cap past $100 billion. The stock rose more than 1% in extended trading. IBM is up close to 5% this year and is now valued at $154 billion.
The companies said the transaction should close by the end of September, subject to regulatory approval and other conditions.
"I expect that we are going to grow significant consulting business on Palo Alto's products, much like I have with Azure and AWS," Krishna said in an interview. IBM helps organizations run their software on the Amazon and Microsoft public clouds. He said he hopes to quickly be generating hundreds of millions of dollars in new consulting revenue.
IBM will continue to sell its QRadar software for use in on-premises data centers, Krishna said.
"It's here for years," he said.
At the same time, IBM will suggest that clients using it consider switching to Palo Alto's Cortex Xsiam, Krishna said.

Android 15’s second beta release lets users lock down access to private apps
description3:
Alongside Google’s ongoing developer-focused I/O conference comes the latest release of Android 15, which is now in its second beta. It’s got some cool new features, like the ability to now hide a collection of apps inside a “private space,” customizable vibrations so you can notice different types of notifications just by feeling, and also richer widget previews.
The new private space function is the most interesting of the bunch: it can hide apps you don’t want others seeing into a biometric or PIN-protected container in the app drawer. It’s one of several new security features coming to Android.
Accessing a private space. GIF: Google
Private space leverages Android’s user profiles, so apps that you put in a private space also curtain away notifications for those apps and files made or downloaded within them. One could, for instance, lock away all their dating apps into a space and not get inundated with matches at undesirable times.
Another cool new feature is custom vibrations for incoming notifications. Now users can set distinguishing vibes for a Slack or Teams message versus an Uber Eats delivery update without taking their phone out of their pocket.
Now the widget picker can preview exactly how a widget will look instead of showing a placeholder. Image: Google
For developers that like making widgets, there’s a new rich widget preview ability that helps users understand what it’ll look like before placing it on the homescreen. For instance, when you look inside the Widget Picker and see the option for a contact card, you can now see an actual person from your contacts in the preview instead of a placeholder one.

Microsoft announces the Proteus Controller, a gamepad for Xbox gamers with disabilities
description4:
On Wednesday, Microsoft announced the Proteus Controller, a $299 modular video game controller kit that lets Xbox gamers with disabilities customize their controllers.
Created by peripheral company ByoWave as part of the Designed for Xbox program, the wireless controller consists of small cubes with interchangeable faceplates that include controller buttons, a directional pad, and analog sticks.
The “snap and play” parts connect together so gamers can build more than 100 configurations and LED lighting variations. As a result, one-handed gamers and other players with disabilities can use the controller in a way that’s most comfortable for them. The buttons are also remappable for a more individualized experience, albeit only via the companion app.
The Proteus Controller can be used in multiple ways. Image: Byowave
At launch, the Proteus Controller will work with the Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 and 11. ByoWave says it won’t support PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch, though it’s open to partnering with these platforms.
The controller is expected to ship this fall, though it’s available to preorder via ByoWave’s website at a discounted price of $255 right now. The kit will include a USB-C charging cable and a Bluetooth dongle, as well as other parts like left and right handles to create a traditional gamepad and two large one-button peripherals.
Along with introducing a new controller, Microsoft is also updating its $99.99 Xbox Adaptive Controller, which was released in 2018 to help players build adaptive gaming setups."
