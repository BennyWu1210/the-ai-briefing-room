Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday June 19), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nNvidia overtakes Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company\ndescription0:\nLess than two weeks after Nvidia jumped Apple in terms of its overall valuation, the GPU maker has now passed Microsoft to stand as the world\u2019s most valuable company based on the chips it makes that are key to powering a boom in generative AI technology.\nAt the close of trading on Tuesday, its share price stood at $135.58, up $4.60 from the previous day and pushing its market cap to $3.335 trillion. That\u2019s more than Microsoft ($3.32 trillion), Apple ($3.29 trillion), and Google ($2.17 trillion). Nvidia\u2019s shares split 10-for-1 after June 7th, lowering the overall share price, but the spike in the company\u2019s value has been jarring. Its share price has gone up 160 percent in 2024, and the company only passed the $2 trillion mark in February.\n\ntitle1:\nSecurity bug allows anyone to spoof Microsoft employee emails\ndescription1:\nA researcher has found a bug that allows anyone to impersonate Microsoft corporate email accounts, making phishing attempts look credible and more likely to trick their targets.\nAs of this writing, the bug has not been patched. To demonstrate the bug, the researcher sent an email to TechCrunch that looked like it was sent from Microsoft\u2019s account security team.\nLast week, Vsevolod Kokorin, also known online as Slonser, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that he found the email-spoofing bug and reported it to Microsoft, but the company dismissed his report after saying it couldn\u2019t reproduce his findings. This prompted Kokorin to publicize the bug on X, without providing technical details that would help others exploit it.\nI want to share my recent case:\n> I found a vulnerability that allows sending a message from any user@domain\n> We cannot reproduce it\n> I send a video with the exploitation, a full PoC\n> We cannot reproduce it\nAt this point, I decided to stop the communication with Microsoft. pic.twitter.com/mJDoHTn9Xv \u2014 slonser (@slonser_) June 14, 2024\n\u201cMicrosoft just said they couldn\u2019t reproduce it without providing any details,\u201d Kokorin told TechCrunch in an online chat. \u201cMicrosoft might have noticed my tweet because a few hours ago they reopen [sic] one of my reports that I had submitted several months ago.\u201d\nThe bug, according to Kokorin, only works when sending the email to Outlook accounts. Still, that is a pool of at least 400 million users all over the world, according to Microsoft\u2019s latest earnings report.\nKokorin said he last followed up with Microsoft on June 15. Microsoft did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment on Tuesday.\nTechCrunch is not divulging technical details of the bug in order to prevent malicious hackers from exploiting it.\n\u201cI did not expect my post to get such a reaction. Honestly, I just wanted to share my frustration because this situation made me sad,\u201d Kokorin said. \u201cMany people misunderstood me and think that I want money or something like that. In reality, I just want companies not to ignore researchers and to be more friendly when you try to help them.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not known if anyone other than Kokorin found the bug, or if it has been maliciously exploited.\nWhile the threat of this bug, at this point, is unknown, Microsoft has experienced several security problems in recent years, prompting investigations by both federal regulators and congressional lawmakers.\nLast week, Microsoft president Brad Smith testified in a House hearing after China stole a tranche of U.S. federal government emails from Microsoft\u2019s servers in 2023. In the hearing, Smith pledged a renewed effort to prioritize cybersecurity in the company after a slew of security embarrassments.\nMonths earlier, in January, Microsoft confirmed that a Russian-government linked hacking group had broken into Microsoft corporate emails accounts to steal information about what the company\u2019s top executives knew about the hackers themselves. And last week, ProPublica revealed that Microsoft had failed to heed warnings about a critical flaw that was later exploited in the Russian-backed cyber espionage campaign that targeted tech company SolarWinds.\n\ntitle2:\nFTC refers TikTok child privacy case to Justice Department\ndescription2:\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced on Tuesday that it has referred a complaint against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance to the Department of Justice. The agency was investigating the company over potential violations of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act and was looking into whether TikTok violated a law that prohibits \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d business practices.\n\u201cThe investigation uncovered reason to believe named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and that a proceeding is in the public interest, so the Commission has voted to refer a complaint to the DOJ, according to the procedures outlined in the FTC Act,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\nTikTok issued a public statement noting that it has been working with the FTC for more than a year to address its concerns and that it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the agency is pursuing litigation.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the FTC\u2019s allegations, many of which relate to past events and practices that are factually inaccurate or have been addressed,\u201d TikTok\u2019s statement reads. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we\u2019ve done to protect children and we will continue to update and improve our product.\u201d\nThe FTC notes that although it doesn\u2019t typically announce that it has referred a complaint, it \u201cdetermined that doing so here is in the public interest.\u201d\nTikTok paid $5.7 million in 2019 to settle FTC allegations that it illegally collected personal information from children. The settlement marked the largest civil penalty ever obtained by the Commission in a children\u2019s privacy case, according to the FTC.\nThe announcement comes as TikTok is facing increased scrutiny in the U.S.\nIn April, President Biden signed a bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to sell it within a year. The action was the result of years of concern from U.S. lawmakers who fear that ByteDance may leak U.S. user data to the Chinese government. TikTok and ByteDance responded to the bill by suing the government, arguing that the law violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s commitment to \u201cboth free speech and individual liberty.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\niOS 18 could 'sherlock' $400M in app revenue\ndescription3:\nApple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\nImage Credits: Appfigures\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\nImage Credits: Appfigures\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon union workers and the Teamsters have inked a deal\ndescription4:\nAmazon Labor Union (ALU) members voted to affiliate with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in a move they hope will bring new life to a yearslong struggle to secure union contracts for Amazon warehouse workers.\nAmazon has tried to block various efforts to unionize across different branches of the company since at least 2000, but the movement to unionize warehouse workers only gained steam in the past few years. The Teamsters, founded in 1903, is one of the biggest labor unions in the US.\nEmployees at the Staten Island warehouse, known as JFK8, became the first Amazon workers to vote to unionize in 2022. They still don\u2019t have a contract, as the union struggles to get Amazon to the bargaining table. Union members at JFK8 approved an affiliation agreement with the Teamsters after three days of voting, the groups announced today.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now stronger than ever before.\u201d\nThat means that a new ALU-International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Local 1 will represent some 5,500 Amazon warehouse workers at JFK8. If any other Amazon warehouses in New York City vote to unionize, Local 1 would have jurisdiction for their workers as well.\nStaten Island union organizers now have access to more financial resources thanks to the partnership. The Teamsters, meanwhile, have been trying to unionize Amazon warehouse workers across the US.\n\u201cOn behalf of the Amazon Labor Union, I\u2019m proud of our members choosing a path to victory. We\u2019re now stronger than ever before,\u201d ALU president Chris Smalls said in a press release. \u201cHaving the support of 1.3 million Teamsters to take on Amazon gives us tremendous worker power and the opportunities to demand better conditions for our members and, most importantly, to secure a contract at JFK8.\u201d\nJFK8 workers in particular have faced mounting obstacles since its historic vote to unionize in 2022. Amazon quickly objected to the results of the election and has yet to agree to bargain with the ALU, The New York Times reports. Amazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.\nAmazon workers at the company\u2019s biggest US air cargo hub, KCVG in Kentucky, also voted to affiliate with the Teamsters earlier this month. But so far, JFK8 is still the only Amazon warehouse to have successfully voted to unionize.\nThe Teamsters secured a win with UPS warehouse workers in a new contract last year.\"\n\nResponse:",
