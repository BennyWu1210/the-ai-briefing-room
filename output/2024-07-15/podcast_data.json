Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday July 16), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple iOS 18 public beta released: How to install\ndescription0:\nTim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, US, on Monday, June 10, 2024.\nApple on Monday released a preview version of its big new iPhone update.\nThe iOS 18 public preview is a beta version of the software that will launch alongside new iPhones this fall, allowing Apple fans and developers to test the newest features before they officially launch and identify bugs before all iPhone users install the new software.\nThis year, however, the most important new service isn't in the public beta: Apple Intelligence. In June, Apple announced that some of its newer devices would be able to access Apple's AI service that can answer questions intelligently, control your iPhone, and even generate images.\nApple said that Apple Intelligence will be released in a beta version this fall and users will be able to try it out this summer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration, and some Siri improvements, aren't expected to be released until later this year.\nHowever, there are still many changes in this version of iOS that will change the way that iPhones look and feel and could surprise users when they first install the software. Apple has updated several of the core user interface elements of the device, including the lock screen, home screen, and Control Center to support a wider range of colors and customization.\nTop apps such as Photos have been redesigned. Messages is more colorful and supports emoji reactions. Users can even change all their app icons to the same color.\nMany of these look-and-feel features have been available to Android users for years, but they will be new to longtime iPhone users and are part of a multiyear process in which Apple is opening up the formerly rigid iPhone software design to greater visual customization, after last year's release redesigned the device's lock screen.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle in talks for $23 billion deal with Wiz, largest ever\ndescription1:\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., during Stanford's 2024 Business, Government, and Society forum in Stanford, California, April 3, 2024.\nGoogle is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who said a deal is expected to close \"soon.\"\nWiz was founded in 2020, and has grown at a rapid clip under CEO Assaf Rappaport. It had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when the company achieved a valuation of $12 billion.\nA representative for Wiz declined to comment. Google did not return a request for comment.\nWiz\u2019s cloud security offering gives executives and cybersecurity professionals insight into a company\u2019s full cloud presence, something appealing to large firms with significant computing resources. It is backed by a roster of blue chip firms, including Israeli VC firm Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.\nIf completed, the deal would be Google\u2019s largest-ever acquisition. It would also underline a clear and continued bet on cybersecurity, at a time when nation-state and criminal actors have managed to disrupt governments and large organizations. Google has made large cyber acquisitions before: The company acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago.\nBut the company now faces unprecedented levels of antitrust scrutiny. The Justice Department has sued Google twice on antitrust grounds. The company\u2019s acquisition practices were highlighted in the most recent litigation, filed in 2023.\nBut its talks with Wiz would suggest that the company has developed a fresh appetite for mergers and acquisitions, competitive concerns notwithstanding. Google had been in talks to acquire sales software maker Hubspot, CNBC previously reported, but its pursuit had reportedly cooled.\nThe news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\ntitle2:\nMajor Stripe investor Sequoia confirms $70B valuation, offers its investors a payday\ndescription2:\nPayments giant Stripe has delayed going public for so long that its major investor Sequoia Capital is getting creative to offer returns to its limited partners.\nThe venture firm emailed LPs in funds raised between 2009 and 2011 with an offer to buy up to $861 million worth of shares in Stripe, Axios reported. Sequoia has declined to comment but the buyers would be other, newer Sequoia funds, according to the email sent to LPs, that was shared by Axios.\nThe move is notable for two reasons. For one, it\u2019s evidence that LPs are increasingly antsy for liquidity in this dry IPO market. (2024 thus far has delivered just four venture-backed tech IPOs \u2014 Reddit, Astera Labs, Ibotta and Rubrik \u2014 in March and April.)\nBut perhaps more telling is that Sequoia\u2019s gesture reflects that the firm is confident not only of Stripe\u2019s future, but in its ability to eventually exit in a way that will reward investors handsomely. In the letter to LPs, Sequoia wrote that it remained \u201chighly optimistic about Stripe\u2019s future\u201d and that the company is \u201cdurable across economic cycles.\u201d\nRemember, in March of 2021 Stripe was valued at $95 billion, making it one of the highest-valued private startups in the world, and appeared to be steamrolling toward a big, highly-anticipated IPO. In January of 2023, it was reported that Stripe had set a 12-month deadline for itself to go public or it would pursue a transaction on the private market, such as a fundraising event and a tender offer.\nIt obviously opted for the latter.\nLast summer, Stripe was valued at $50 billion when it raised $6.5 billion in Series I funding, a big haircut from its heyday $95 billion. In February, TechCrunch reported that Stripe had inked deals with investors to provide liquidity to current and former employees through a tender offer at a $65 billion valuation. While that meant it is climbing back to that peak valuation, it was still far below the high mark.\nStill, even at $65 billion, Stripe remained one of the world\u2019s most valued startups.\nSince 2011, Sequoia has invested a total of $517 million in Stripe. In its letter to LPs, the firm noted that Stripe\u2019s most recent 409A valuation was $70 billion and that Sequoia\u2019s entire position is valued at $9.8 billion. As a whole, Sequoia reportedly distributed $10 billion to its investors in 2023.\nNow that Stripe has conducted a big tender offer, and Sequoia is maneuvering to return cash to earlier funds, this is another indication that the fintech giant not likely planning an IPO anytime soon. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that Sequoia partner Luciana Lixandru and Kevin Kelly, a partner from Sequoia Heritage, the firm\u2019s separate wealth management business, both sit on Stripe\u2019s board, giving them inside knowledge of Stripe\u2019s financial plans. Lixandru replaced Michael Moritz\u2019s board seat after he exited the storied VC firm in December.\nThere is, of course, the possibility that Stripe will never go public. Despite increased competition, 15-year-old Stripe has continued to grow impressively. In March, Stripe noted in its annual letter that it had crossed the $1 trillion total payment volume metric in 2023 after seeing a 25% bump in its payment volume. The company also said in the letter that it was \u201crobustly cash flow positive in 2023 and expects to be again in 2024,\u201d which means it won\u2019t feel the urgency to raise capital, even as it searches for ways to allow its employees and VC investors to sell shares.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

And big-box retailers Walmart and Target have lowered the price of certain grocery goods.\n\"It's very difficult in this environment to engineer great profits, great sales and to keep customers satisfied,\" said Neil Saunders, GlobalData's managing director and retail analyst. \"It's a very difficult equation to balance. And I think until the economy is on a different footing, it's not going to be balanced completely. That's the reality of it.\"\nAmid this tough economic backdrop, McDonald's announced its plan this year to spend $2 billion into employing AI and robots into restaurant and drive-thrus. And in 2022, grocery stores spent $13 billion on tech automations, according to research by FMI, The Food Industry Association. FMI expects spending on innovations like smart carts and revamped self-checkout aisles to soar 400% through 2025.\n\"We see a lot of upside over the next several years, with AI and technology being able to enhance customer experience while making the team members' jobs a lot easier, \" said Joe Park, Yum Brands' chief digital and technology officer.\nWatch the video to find out more about how the food industry is using AI to reshape the customer experience.\n\ntitle4:\nCrypto stocks like Coinbase and Microstrategy soar as bitcoin rallies\ndescription4:\nSAN ANSELMO, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 06: In this photo illustration, the Coinbase logo is displayed on a screen on June 06, 2023 in San Anselmo, California. The Securities And Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase for allegedly violating securities laws by acting as an exchange, a broker and a clearing agency without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nCoinbase , MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms surged Monday as investors piled into crypto companies following bitcoin's rally to a two-week high.\nThe price of bitcoin has been rising since the attempted assassination of Donald Trump over the weekend, with investors betting that the Republican presumptive nominee is now more likely to win the election in November. In recent months, Trump has been making increasingly bullish comments on crypto, and last week he signed on to headline the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee.\nBitcoin is up about 6% in the past 24 hours, trading at around $63,500 as of early Monday afternoon.\nShares of Coinbase, the largest centralized digital asset exchange in the U.S., jumped 12% to $243.27, on pace for their best day since February. Bitcoin accounted for 33% of trading volume on the platform in the first quarter, by far the biggest amount for any cryptocurrency. Ethereum accounted for 13% of volume.\nBitcoin miner Riot Platforms surged 16%, while rival Marathon Digital soared 17%. Miners tend to gain when bitcoin rises in price because it increases the value of their operations.\nMicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, climbed 17% on Monday. The stock is up more than 150% this year. On Thursday, the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split, in order \"to make MicroStrategy's stock more accessible to investors and employees.\"\"\n\nResponse:",
