Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The company will soon launch its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, into its core products, putting generative AI in front of Apple\u2019s 2 billion users.\nApple joins 15 other technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI \u2014 that committed to the White House\u2019s ground rules for developing generative AI in July 2023. At the time, Apple had not revealed how deeply it planned to ingrain AI into iOS. But we heard Apple loud and clear at WWDC in June: It\u2019s going all in on generative AI, starting with a partnership that embeds ChatGPT in the iPhone. As a frequent target of federal regulators, Apple wants to signal early that it\u2019s willing to play by the White House\u2019s rules on AI \u2014 a possible attempt to curry favor before any future regulatory battles on AI break out.\nBut how much teeth do Apple\u2019s voluntary commitments to the White House have? Not much, but it\u2019s a start. The White House calls this the \u201cfirst step\u201d toward Apple and 15 other AI companies developing AI that is safe, secure and trustworthy. The second step was President Biden\u2019s AI executive order in October, and there are several bills currently moving through federal and state legislatures to better regulate AI models.\nUnder the commitment, AI companies promise to red-team (acting as an adversarial hacker to stress test an organization\u2019s safety measures) AI models before a public release and share that information with the public. The White House\u2019s voluntary commitment also asks AI companies to treat unreleased AI model weights confidentially. Apple and other companies agree to work on AI model weights in secure environments, limiting access to model weights to as few employees as possible. Lastly, the AI companies agree to develop content labeling systems, such as watermarking, to help users distinguish what is and isn\u2019t AI generated.\nSeparately, the Department of Commerce says it will soon release a report on the potential benefits, risks and implications of open-source foundation models. Open-source AI is increasingly becoming a politically charged regulatory battlefield. Some camps want to limit how accessible model weights to powerful AI models should be in the name of safety. However, doing so could significantly limit the AI startup and research ecosystem. The White House\u2019s stance here could have a significant impact on the greater AI industry.\nThe White House also noted that federal agencies have made significant progress on tasks set out by the October executive order. Federal agencies have made more than 200 AI-related hires to date, awarded more than 80 research teams\u2019 access to computational resources, and released several frameworks for developing AI (the government loves frameworks).\n\ntitle2:\nSpaceX cleared to resume Falcon 9 launches while FAA investigation remains open\ndescription2:\nRegulators have given SpaceX the all-clear to return to launch with the Falcon 9 rocket two weeks after the vehicle experienced an anomaly on orbit.\nIt\u2019s a quick turnaround for the space company, which had to conduct an investigation overseen by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, identify the probable cause of the anomaly, and the corrective actions it will take to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again. This course of action is standard after a rocket launch goes wrong.\nSpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 experienced a rare issue on orbit after a routine launch of a batch of Starlink satellites on July 11. While launch and stage separation proceeded as expected, the second stage experienced a catastrophic issue. Twenty satellites were deployed, but were in an orbit too low to survive. All of the satellites have reentered the atmosphere and burned up.\nLate Thursday, SpaceX confirmed in an update posted to its website that the problem was due to a liquid oxygen leak in the insulation surrounding the second stage\u2019s single Merlin engine. That leak was due to a crack in a sensing line connected to the pressure sensor, which developed due to a loose clamp in the line and the strain from engine vibration.\nDespite the leak, which occurred during the first firing of the second stage engine on orbit, the mission continued to proceed as normal. But the liquid oxygen made the engine components ultra-cold; as a result, the second attempted firing did not go to plan. Instead of a controlled burn, the engine \u201cexperienced a hard start,\u201d SpaceX said, which damaged the engine and caused the upper stage to lose its orientation on orbit.\nSpaceX has removed the failed sense line and sensor on the second stage engine for near-term Falcon 9 launches, which are not used in the flight safety system, the company said. The company has already tested the design change at its rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. The company also conducted additional inspections of all sense lines on its active second stage fleet, leading to \u201cproactive replacement\u201d in some instances, SpaceX added in its update.\nPrior to this issue, SpaceX boasted a 335-launch streak across its Falcon family of rockets. That includes 96 successful launches in 2023 and 69 successful launches this year.\nWhile the FAA said in a statement that the overall investigation is still open, SpaceX said it had submitted its mishap report to the regulator.\n\u201cAfter a comprehensive review, the FAA determined no public safety issues were involved in the anomaly that occurred during the SpaceX Starlink Group 9-3 launch on July 11,\u201d the regulator said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThis public safety determination means the Falcon 9 vehicle may return to flight operations while the overall investigation remains open, provided all other license requirements are met.\u201d\nSpaceX is aiming to conduct its next Falcon 9 launch on July 27. That launch will carry another batch of Starlink satellites to orbit.\n\ntitle3:\nCrowdStrike CEO says 97% of Windows sensors back online after outage\ndescription3:\nIn this article CRWD Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nThe blue screen of death errors on computer screens are viewed due to the global communications outage caused by CrowdStrike, which provides cyber security services to US technology company Microsoft, on July 19, 2024 in Ankara, Turkey. Harun Ozalp | Anadolu | Getty Images\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said that over 97% of Windows sensors are back online after an update from the cybersecurity firm caused one of the world's biggest IT outages. \"To our customers still affected, please know we will not rest until we achieve full recovery,\" Kurtz said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday. Last week, CrowdStrike issued a routine update to its users around the world \u2014 which mainly comprise large businesses \u2014 that had a bug which caused Microsoft's Windows operating system to crash.\nMany users woke up on Friday to a blue screen error on Windows. The IT outage sparked chaos around the world, with flights being cancelled, businesses closing early and even medical staff scrambling to keep operations running. CrowdStrike rolled back the update to fix the issue. The company's share price has been hammered since the incident, as CEO Kurtz looks to contain the reputational fallout. \"I am deeply sorry for the disruption this outage has caused and personally apologize to everyone impacted. While I can't promise perfection, I can promise a response that is focused, effective, and with a sense of urgency,\" he wrote on LinkedIn.\n\ntitle4:\nApple loses top 5 spot in China smartphone market as domestic brands dominate\ndescription4:\nCustomers are shopping for the iPhone 15 at the flagship store of Apple Smart Products on Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street in Shanghai, China, on May 24, 2024.\nApple was edged out of the top five smartphone vendors' list in China in the second quarter, as competition from domestic brands such as Huawei intensifies, according to a Canalys report.\nApple's market share in China shrank to 14% in the second quarter, the report released Thursday showed, from 15% in the first quarter and 16% in the same period a year ago.\nThe iPhone maker, which was the third-largest smartphone vendor in the second quarter last year, dropped to the sixth spot with about 9.7 million in shipments, according to CNBC calculations.\n\"It is the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,\" said Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys.\nApple's shipments have been declining since the first quarter when they dropped 25% year on year to 10 million units.\n\"Chinese vendors' strategies for high-end products and their deep collaboration with local supply chains are starting to pay off in hardware and software features. Honor's latest Magic V3, which leverages GenAI, has significantly enhanced the user experience of foldable devices,\" Zhong added.\nOn the other hand, Apple is facing a \"bottleneck\" in the Chinese market as it aims to \"stabilize retail prices and protect margins of channel partners,\" he said.\nLocalization of Apple Intelligence services in China will be an important move in the next 12 months, Canalys said, as Chinese brands are aggressively incorporating generative AI into their products.\"\n\nResponse:",
