        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.

Elon Musk's X loses lawsuit against Bright Data over data scraping
description0:
A federal judge in California dismissed a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's X against Israel's Bright Data, in a case that involved the scraping of public online data and its appropriate uses.
X, formerly Twitter, sued Bright Data, alleging the company "scrapes data from X" and sells it "using elaborate technical measures to evade X Corp.'s anti-scraping technology." X also claimed the company violated its terms of service and copyright.
Data scraping occurs when automated programs scour publicly accessible websites to collect data, which can later be used for a wide range of purposes, including training artificial intelligence models and targeting online ads. The practice is generally legal in the U.S. when it involves scraping publicly accessible data, according to a 2022 ruling that capped off an extended legal battle involving LinkedIn.
X was previously seeking more than $1 million in damages from unknown defendants over "unlawfully scraping data associated with Texas residents," according to a suit that was filed in Dallas County.
In dismissing the complaint, Judge William Alsup wrote, "X Corp. wants it both ways: to keep its safe harbors yet exercise a copyright owner's right to exclude, wresting fees from those who wish to extract and copy X users' content."
Giving social networks complete control over the collection and use of public web data "risks the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest," the judge wrote. He added that X was not "looking to protect X users' privacy," and was "happy to allow the extraction and copying of X users' content so long as it gets paid."
A representative for X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meta previously filed a complaint against Bright Data and was similarly unsuccessful.
Bright Data said in an emailed statement that its victories against Meta and X show that public information online "belongs to all of us, and any attempt to deny the public access will fail."
"What is happening now is unprecedented, the implications impact general business, research, AI and beyond," the company said.
Bright Data says it only scrapes publicly available data that's visible to anyone without a login. At the time of the suit's filing, X made the information Bright Data scraped available to anyone.

Sam Altman's Oklo plunges 54% in NYSE debut after SPAC
description1:
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, attends the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2024.
Sam Altman is now chairman of a public company. But it's not OpenAI.
On Friday, advanced nuclear fission company Oklo started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has yet to generate any revenue, went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called AltC Acquisition Corp., founded and led by Altman.
Under the ticker symbol "OKLO ," shares plummeted 54% on Friday to $8.45, valuing the company at about $364 million. Oklo received roughly $306 million in gross proceeds in the transaction, according to a release.
Oklo's business model is based on commercializing nuclear fission, the reaction that fuels all nuclear power plants. Instead of conventional reactors, the company aims to use mini nuclear reactors housed in A-frame structures. Its goal is to sell the energy to end users such as the U.S. Air Force and big tech companies.
Oklo is currently working to build its first small-scale reactor in Idaho, which could eventually power the types of data centers that OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies need to run their AI models and services.
Altman is co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which has been valued at over $80 billion by private investors. He's said that he sees nuclear energy as one of the best ways to solve the problem of growing demand for AI, and the energy that powers the technology, without relying on fossil fuels. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have also invested in nuclear plants in recent years.
"I don't see a way for us to get there without nuclear," Altman told CNBC in 2023. "I mean, maybe we could get there just with solar and storage. But from my vantage point, I feel like this is the most likely and the best way to get there."
In an interview with CNBC Thursday, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte confirmed that the company has yet to generate revenue and has no nuclear plants deployed at the moment. He said the company is targeting 2027 for its first plant to come online.
Going the SPAC route is risky. So-called reverse mergers became popular in the low-interest rate days of 2020 and 2021 when tech valuations were soaring and investors were looking for growth over profit. But the SPAC market collapsed in 2022 alongside rising rates and hasn't recovered.
AI-related companies, on the other hand, are the new darlings of Wall Street.
"SPACs haven't exactly had the best performances in the past couple of years, so for us to have sort of the outcome that we've had here is obviously a function of the work we put in, but also what we're building and also the fact that the market sees the opportunity sets here," said DeWitte, who co-founded the company in 2013. "I think it's very promising on multiple fronts for [the] nuclear, AI, data center push, as well as the energy transition piece."
The company has seen its fair share of regulatory setbacks. In 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission denied Oklo's application for an Idaho reactor. The company has been working on a new application, which it isn't aiming to submit to the NRC until early next year, DeWitte said, adding that it's currently in the "pre-application engagement" stage with the commission.
Altman got involved with Oklo while president of the startup incubator Y Combinator. Oklo went into the program in 2014 after an earlier meeting between Altman and DeWitte. In 2015, Altman invested in the company and became chairman.
It's not Altman's only foray into nuclear energy or other infrastructure that could power large-scale AI growth.
In 2021, Altman led a $500 million funding round in clean energy firm Helion, which is working to develop and commercialize nuclear fusion. Helion said in a blog post at the time that the capital would go toward its electricity demonstration generator, Polaris, "which we expect to demonstrate net electricity from fusion in 2024."
Altman didn't respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, Altman has also poured money into chip endeavors and investments that could help power the AI tools OpenAI builds.
Just before his brief ouster as OpenAI CEO in November, he was reportedly seeking billions of dollars for a chip venture codenamed "Tigris" to eventually compete with Nvidia .
Altman in 2018 invested in AI chip startup Rain Neuromorphics, based near OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters. The next year, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on Rain's chips. In December, the U.S. compelled a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm to sell its shares in Rain.
DeWitte told CNBC that the data center represents "a pretty exciting opportunity."
"What we've seen is there's a lot of interest with AI, specifically," he said. "AI compute needs are significant. It opens the door for a lot of different approaches in terms of how people think about designing and developing AI infrastructure."

China's SMIC warns of fierce chip competition as it misses profit estimates

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation on Friday warned of intense competition in the chip industry after its first-quarter profit missed expectations.
"Competition in the industry has been increasingly fierce and the pricing for commodity products basically follows the market trends," SMIC said on Friday during the firm's earnings call.
"The company fulfills its [long-term view] through constructing quality technology platforms that leap here in mainland China by one to two generations," said SMIC.
SMIC, China's biggest contract chip manufacturer, is seen as critical to Beijing's ambitions of cutting foreign reliance in its domestic semiconductor industry as the U.S. continues to curb China's tech power. SMIC lags behind Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, according to analysts.
The company's first-quarter net income plunged 68.9% from a year earlier to $71.79 million, compared with LSEG analysts' average estimate of $80.49 million.
Gross margin slid to 13.7% in the quarter – the lowest the firm has ever recorded in nearly 12 years – according to LSEG data.
Revenue for the first quarter was $1.75 billion, up 19.7% from a year earlier, as customers stocked up on chips, SMIC said. This handily beat LSEG estimate of $1.69 billion.

Tesla accused by NLRB of chilling worker unionizing efforts in Buffalo
description3:
Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X Holdings Corp., speaks at the Milken Institute's Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel,on May 6, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.
Tesla is being accused of taking steps to keep employees in Buffalo, New York, from unionizing, according to a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board.
On Tuesday, the NLRB's regional director for Buffalo, Linda Leslie, filed the complaint. In it, she said Tesla "promulgated and maintained," an acceptable use policy for workplace technology in 2023 that was meant to "discourage its employees from forming, joining, or assisting the Union or engaging in other concerted activities," after allegations were raised by members of Workers United.
CNBC obtained a copy of the complaint through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The policy restricted Tesla workers from "recording, unauthorized solicitating [sic] or promoting," and "creating channels and distribution lists," among other things, the complaint said.
The NLRB also claims the policy had the effect of "interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed" under the National Labor Relations Act, which generally protects workers' rights to discuss organizing, join a union, and collectively negotiate for better pay and working conditions.
The Tesla Buffalo plant was supposed to manufacture solar panels, but has been used more recently to assemble electric vehicle charging equipment, and to house a team of AI software data labelers.
Last month, the Buffalo plant was home to a number of job cuts put in place as part of a broader restructuring at the electric vehicle company. According to a WARN notice filed in the state, Tesla is laying off 285 employees in the state of New York, mostly at the Buffalo factory. The company is eliminating thousands of jobs worldwide after declining EV sales in the first quarter.
Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have clashed with union proponents for years and were found to have engaged in union-busting. In 2021, the NLRB decided that Tesla violated labor laws when it fired a union activist, and when Musk wrote on Twitter in 2018: "Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?"
An administrative court ordered the CEO to remove the post. Tesla challenged the order but its petition for review was denied. The post in question remains on Musk's X account, where he has 182.7 million listed followers.
Tesla has also faced workers' rights challenges in Europe. Last year, Swedish service technicians began a strike that continues today, with the labor group allowing for some authorized work to take place at times. The employees in Sweden, where a majority of the workplace is involved in unions, are seeking a collective bargaining agreement with Tesla.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Alibaba rolls out latest version of its large language model
description4:
The logo of the Alibaba office building is seen in the Huangpu District in Shanghai, June 16, 2023.
Alibaba Cloud said on Thursday it released the latest version of its large language model after more than 90,000 deployments by companies.
Jingren Zhou, chief technology officer of Alibaba Cloud, said in a statement the firm has seen "many creative applications of the models from across the industries," including consumer electronics and gaming.
"We look forward to collaborating with our customers and developers in seizing the immense
growth opportunities presented by the latest surge in the generative AI development," said Zhou.
Alibaba Cloud said the latest version of its Tongyi Qianwen model, Qwen2.5, possesses "remarkable advancements in reasoning, code comprehension, and textual understanding compared to its predecessor Qwen2.0."
Large language models power artificial intelligence applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. They are trained on vast amounts of data to generate humanlike responses to user prompts.
The latest Qwen model fares better than OpenAI's GPT-4 model in language and creation capabilities, but fell short in other categories like knowledge, reasoning and math, according to a March analysis by large language model evaluation platform OpenCompass."
