Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday May 23), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMeta\u2019s new AI council is composed entirely of white men\ndescription0:\nMeta on Wednesday announced the creation of an AI advisory council with only white men on it. What else would we expect? Women and people of color have been speaking out for decades about being ignored and excluded from the world of artificial intelligence despite them being qualified and playing a key role in the evolution of this space.\nMeta did not immediately respond to our request to comment about the diversity of the advisory board.\nThis new advisory board differs from Meta\u2019s actual board of directors and its Oversight Board, which is more diverse in gender and racial representation. Shareholders did not elect this AI board, which also has no fiduciary duty. Meta told Bloomberg that the board would offer \u201cinsights and recommendations on technological advancements, innovation, and strategic growth opportunities.\u201d It would meet \u201cperiodically.\u201d\nIt\u2019s telling that the AI advisory council is composed entirely of businesspeople and entrepreneurs, not ethicists or anyone with an academic or deep research background. While one could argue that current and former Stripe, Shopify and Microsoft executives are well positioned to oversee Meta\u2019s AI product roadmap given the immense number of products they\u2019ve brought to market among them, it\u2019s been proven time and time again that AI isn\u2019t like other products. It\u2019s a risky business, and the consequences of getting it wrong can be far-reaching, particularly for marginalized groups.\nIn a recent interview with TechCrunch, Sarah Myers West, managing director at the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit that studies the social implications of AI, said that it\u2019s crucial to \u201ccritically examine\u201d the institutions producing AI to \u201cmake sure the public\u2019s needs [are] served.\u201d\n\u201cThis is error-prone technology, and we know from independent research that those errors are not distributed equally, they disproportionately harm communities that have long borne the brunt of discrimination,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be setting a much, much higher bar.\u201d\nWomen are far more likely than men to experience the dark side of AI. Sensity AI found in 2019 that 96% of AI deepfake videos online were nonconsensual, sexually explicit videos. Generative AI has become far more prevalent since then, and women are still the targets of this violative behavior.\nIn one high-profile incident from January, nonconsensual, pornographic deepfakes of Taylor Swift went viral on X, with one of the most widespread posts receiving hundreds of thousands of likes, and 45 million views. Social platforms like X have historically failed at protecting women from these circumstances \u2014 but since Taylor Swift is one of the most powerful women in the world, X intervened by banning search terms like \u201ctaylor swift ai\u201d and taylor swift deepfake.\u201d\nBut if this happens to you and you\u2019re not a global pop sensation, then you might be out of luck. There are numerous reports of middle school and high school-aged students making explicit deepfakes of their classmates. While this technology has been around for a while, it\u2019s never been easier to access \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be technologically savvy to download apps that are specifically advertised to \u201cundress\u201d photos of women or swap their faces onto pornography. In fact, according to reporting by NBC\u2019s Kat Tenbarge, Facebook and Instagram hosted ads for an app called Perky AI, which described itself as a tool to make explicit images.\nTwo of the ads, which allegedly escaped Meta\u2019s detection until Tenbarge alerted the company to the issue, showed photos of celebrities Sabrina Carpenter and Jenna Ortega with their bodies blurred out, urging customers to prompt the app to remove their clothes. The ads used an image of Ortega from when she was just 16 years old.\nThe mistake of allowing Perky AI to advertise was not an isolated incident. Meta\u2019s Oversight Board recently opened investigations into the company\u2019s failure to handle reports of sexually explicit, AI-generated content.\nIt is imperative for women\u2019s and people of color\u2019s voices to be included in the innovation of artificial intelligence products. For so long, such marginalized groups have been excluded from the development of world-changing technologies and research, and the results have been disastrous.\nAn easy example is the fact that until the 1970s, women were excluded from clinical trials, meaning entire fields of research developed without the understanding of how it would impact women. Black people, in particular, see the impacts of technology built without them in mind \u2014 for example, self-driving cars are more likely to hit them because their sensors might have a harder time detecting Black skin, according to a 2019 study done by the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nAlgorithms trained on already discriminatory data only regurgitate the same biases that humans have trained them to adopt. Broadly, we already see AI systems perpetuating and amplifying racial discrimination in employment, housing and criminal justice. Voice assistants struggle to understand diverse accents and often flag the work by non-native English speakers as being AI-generated since, as Axios noted, English is AI\u2019s native tongue. Facial recognition systems flag Black people as possible matches for criminal suspects more often than white people.\nThe current development of AI embodies the same existing power structures regarding class, race, gender and Eurocentrism that we see elsewhere, and it seems not enough leaders are addressing it. Instead, they are reinforcing it. Investors, founders and tech leaders are so focused on moving fast and breaking things that they can\u2019t seem to understand that generative AI \u2014 the hot AI tech of the moment \u2014 could make the problems worse, not better. According to a report from McKinsey, AI could automate roughly half of all jobs that don\u2019t require a four-year degree and pay over $42,000 annually, jobs in which minority workers are overrepresented.\nThere is cause to worry about how a team of all-white men at one of the most prominent tech companies in the world, engaging in this race to save the world using AI, could ever advise on products for all people when only one narrow demographic is represented. It will take a massive effort to build technology that everyone \u2014 truly everyone \u2014 could use. In fact, the layers needed to actually build safe and inclusive AI \u2014 from the research to the understanding on an intersectional societal level \u2014 are so intricate that it\u2019s almost obvious that this advisory board will not help Meta get it right. At least where Meta falls short, another startup could arise.\nWe\u2019re launching an AI newsletter! Sign up here to start receiving it in your inboxes on June 5.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon, Meta back Scale AI in $1 billion funding deal\ndescription1:\nArtificial intelligence startup Scale AI said Tuesday that it has raised $1 billion in a Series F funding round that values the enterprise tech company at $13.8 billion \u2014 almost double its last reported valuation. The San Francisco-based company, ranked No. 12 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, has now raised $1.6 billion to date.\nIts latest funding round is being led by Accel, and includes Cisco Investments, DFJ Growth, Intel Capital, ServiceNow Ventures, AMD Ventures, WCM, Amazon, Elad Gil (co-founder of Color Genomics and serial tech investor), and Meta, all of which are new investors in the company.\nExisting investors including Y Combinator, Nat Friedman, Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Coatue, Thrive Capital, Spark Capital, Nvidia, Tiger Global Management, Greenoaks, and Wellington Management also participated in the round.\nScale AI is playing a key role in the rise of generative artificial intelligence and large language models, with the data \u2014 whether it is text, images, video or voice recordings \u2014 needing to be labeled correctly before it can be digested and used effectively by AI technology. Scale AI has evolved from labeling data used to train models that powered autonomous driving to now helping to improve and fine tune the underlying data for nearly any organization looking to implement AI, powering some of the most advanced models in use.\n\"Our calling is to build the data foundry for AI, and with today's funding, we're moving into the next phase of that journey \u2013 accelerating the abundance of frontier data that will pave our road to AGI,\" founder and CEO Alexandr Wang said in a statement announcing the news.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia will now make new AI chips every year\ndescription2:\nNvidia just made $14 billion worth of profit in a single quarter thanks to AI chips, and it\u2019s hitting the gas from here on out: Nvidia will now design new chips every year instead of once every two years, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\u201cI can announce that after Blackwell, there\u2019s another chip. We\u2019re on a one-year rhythm,\u201d Huang just said on the company\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call.\nUntil now, Nvidia\u2019s produced a new architecture roughly once every two years \u2014 revealing Ampere in 2020, Hopper in 2022, and Blackwell in 2024, for example.\n(The industry darling H100 AI chip was Hopper, and the B200 is Blackwell, though those same architectures are used in gaming and creator GPUs as well.)\nBut analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported earlier this month that the next architecture \u201cRubin\u201d is coming in 2025, giving us an R100 AI GPU as soon as next year, and Huang\u2019s comments suggest that report might be on the money.\nHuang says Nvidia will accelerate every other kind of chip it makes to match that cadence, too. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take them all forward at a very fast clip.\u201d\n\u201cNew CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches... a mountain of chips are coming,\u201d he says.\nEarlier on the call, when an analyst asked him to explain how the recent Blackwell GPUs would ramp while Hopper GPUs are still selling well, Huang explained that Nvidia\u2019s new generations of AI GPUs are electrically and mechanically backward-compatible and run the same software. Customers will \u201ceasily transition from H100 to H200 to B100\u201d in their existing data centers, he says.\nHuang also shared a couple of his sales pitches on the call by way of explaining the incredible demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI GPUs:\nWe expect demand to outstrip supply for some time, as we transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everyone\u2019s anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they\u2019re saving money and making money and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\nHe also has a FOMO argument that made me smile:\nThe next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI, and the second one after that gets to announce something that\u2019s 0.3 percent better. Do you want to be the company delivering groundbreaking AI, or the company, you know, delivering 0.3 percent better?\nNvidia\u2019s CFO interestingly says that automotive will be its \u201clargest enterprise vertical within data center this year,\u201d pointing to how Tesla purchased 35,000 H100 GPUs to train its \u201cfull-self driving\u201d system, while \u201cconsumer internet companies\u201d like Meta will continue to be a \u201cstrong growth vertical,\u201d too.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul, monthly subscription price\ndescription3:\nAmazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazon's plans.\nThe Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazon's subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139-per-year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.\nAmazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa.\nWhile Amazon wowed consumers with Alexa's voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini.\nBusiness Insider first reported on Amazon's plans to revamp Alexa and launch a new paid subscription plan in 2024. Amazon's former SVP of devices and services David Limp told The Verge in September that the company was considering charging for a more powerful version of Alexa.\nSome interpreted last week's announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apple 's voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the \"Alexa and Siri killers\" on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.\nThe development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources \u2014 but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure.\nThree former employees pointed to Bezos' early obsession with Alexa, describing it as his passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those funds immediately.\nThat changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with rightsizing Amazon's business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.\nFor instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didn't know an answer that was so easy to find online.\nWhen reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the company's annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a \"substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,\" adding that that included \"an even more intelligent and capable Alexa.\"\nThe team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to the three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.\nAs of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers.\n\ntitle4:\nFCC proposes all AI-generated content in political ads must be disclosed\ndescription4:\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has floated a requirement that AI-generated content be disclosed in political ads \u2014 but not banned.\nChairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel made the official proposal Wednesday that the FCC investigate and seek comment on such a rule. (The agency already ruled AI-generated robocalls illegal, but that was more about them not conforming to automated call rules than the AI piece.)\n\u201cConsumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope [the commissioners] swiftly act on this issue,\u201d she said in a statement accompanying the announcement.\nUnder the envisioned framework, both candidate and issue ads would be required to include an on-air and filed disclosure that AI-generated content was used. This would apply to \u201ccable operators, satellite TV and radio providers,\u201d but not streamers or, say, YouTube, which the FCC lacks the statutory authority to regulate. There would first have to be an agreed-upon definition of AI-generated content.\nThe proposal is of the fact-finding type, the first public step in developing a new regulation. If adopted, the FCC would solicit comment on whether the regulation is necessary to begin with, how the content should be defined and so on. Unlike a rule-making document, these can be voted on whenever, so it\u2019s conceivable \u2014 though unlikely \u2014 that the other Commissioners could give the thumbs-up before close of business Wednesday.\nThe FCC document describes \u201ca clear public interest obligation for Commission licensees, regulatees, and permittees to protect the public from false, misleading, or deceptive programming and to promote an informed public.\u201d\nCertainly it seems intuitively true that most people would like to have some kind of indication when imagery, audio or anything else in a campaign ad is AI-generated; such a regulation would likely also deter low-effort attempts at doing such and help build a basis for going after bad actors like the shady company behind the fake Biden calls.\nI\u2019ve asked the FCC for a bit more information on where this rule would overlap or interact with the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Election Commission (which govern advertising and campaign rules, respectively), and when is the earliest we could expect this proposal to be in force.\"\n\nResponse:",
