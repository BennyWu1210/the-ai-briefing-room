The settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) not only avoids litigation, it puts Cruise in a position to restart operations in the state.\nThe settlement agreement \u201cbring[s] this dispute to a close\u201d allowing the Commission staff to \u201cdevote their resources to Cruise\u2019s regulatory oversight rather than engage in potentially protracted litigation,\u201d reads the ruling. In an emailed statement, Cruise said the company is \u201cgratified\u201d to have reached a settlement, noting that the company has taken \u201cimportant steps to improve our leadership, processes and culture.\u201d\nCruise received backlash in October 2023 after a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian that had been flung into its path after being hit by a human-driven vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian 20 feet as it was attempting a pullover maneuver, a fact that Cruise staff didn\u2019t immediately share with the CPUC and other state and federal regulators when they probed the company. That withholding of information resulted in both the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles pulling Cruise\u2019s permits to operate driverless vehicles in the state.\nSince then, Cruise has implemented a series of \u201ccorrective measures\u201d that seem to have satisfied many of the CPUC\u2019s concerns about the company\u2019s continued autonomous vehicle operations. The agency\u2019s ruling points to actions Cruise has taken, including retaining law firm Quinn Emanuel to conduct an internal investigation of Cruise\u2019s operational structure, creating a more transparent corporate operation and instigating the departure of personnel like former CEO Kyle Vogt.\nThe Commission noted that Cruise has taken responsibility for its past failures and promises to be more transparent with the agency in the future. Cruise also appears to be getting brownie points for seeking to \u201cresolve this dispute expeditiously,\u201d rather than letting the matter go through the expensive and time-consuming slog of decisions, appeals and rehearings.\n\u201cWe conclude that by taking these corrective measures, Cruise is on its way to restoring public trust by making itself a more transparent and cooperative entity that will not hide material information from regulatory agencies who oversee its AV transportation services,\u201d reads the ruling.\nAs part of the agreement, Cruise is also required to regularly share incident information with the CPUC. This includes increased collision reporting as well as monthly reports on incidents involving stopped AVs that must be physically retrieved from the field.\nBefore the infamous October 2 incident, Cruise had also been criticized by members of the public, politicians and law enforcement agencies because its robotaxis had a bad habit of malfunctioning in the middle of traffic.\nCruise has been slowly making its way back onto public roads in other states that have less regulatory red tape. Since April, the AV company has deployed small fleets with human safety operators behind the wheel in Phoenix, Houston and Dallas to map and restart testing.\nCruise may take a similar tack in California, where competitor Waymo is quickly gaining ground. The DMV suspended Cruise\u2019s permits to test and deploy vehicles without a human driver in the front seat, and the CPUC suspended Cruise\u2019s permits to charge for any such service. But Cruise still has an active permit with the DMV to test its vehicles with a safety driver, something the company might lean on as it attempts to close its last chapter and move forward.\nA company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Cruise is committed to rebuilding trust with regulators, officials and communities in San Francisco, Cruise\u2019s hometown, and everywhere it previously operated. Both the DMV and Cruise have confirmed that the company has taken steps to have its other permits reinstated, but neither shared any other updates or a timeline. A Cruise spokesperson said the DMV permits are a necessary condition to reapply for CPUC permits.\nThe CPUC did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s query if the agency is preparing to re-approve any of Cruise\u2019s permits.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI buys Rockset to bolster its enterprise AI\ndescription1:\nOpenAI has acquired Rockset, which builds tools to drive real-time search and data analytics.\nIn a post on its official blog, OpenAI said that it would integrate Rockset\u2019s technology to \u201cpower [its] infrastructure across products.\u201d Members of Rockset\u2019s team will join OpenAI, and Rockset\u2019s existing customers will be transitioned off of Rockset\u2019s platform \u201cgradually.\u201d\nThe financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\u201cRockset\u2019s infrastructure empowers companies to transform their data into actionable intelligence,\u201d OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring these benefits to our customers by integrating Rockset\u2019s foundation into OpenAI products.\u201d\nRockset, which was co-founded in 2016 by ex-Facebook engineers Venkat Venkataramani and Tudor Bosman and database architect Dhruba Borthakur, created tools that allowed companies to automatically ingest data from databases and public cloud storage services and then index that data for search and analytics applications.\nRockset\u2019s database platform underpinned things like recommendation engines, logistics-tracking dashboards and \u2014 especially relevant to OpenAI \u2014 chatbots in domains such as fintech and e-commerce.\nRockset managed to raise over $117.5 million in capital from investors including Icon Ventures, Sequoia and Greylock prior to the acquisition, according to Crunchbase data. It also had name-brand customers including Meta and JetBlue, which used Rockset as a component of its flight delay predictions chatbot.\nSo what might OpenAI build with Rockset\u2019s tech? Well, the blog post mentions allowing companies to \u201cbetter leverage their own data\u201d and \u201caccess real-time information\u201d as they use OpenAI products. One can imagine improved tooling to \u201cground\u201d OpenAI\u2019s models on a company\u2019s data, perhaps toward reducing hallucinations or fine-tuning the model for any number of business use cases.\nVenkataramani gives a preview in the blog post accompanying the announcement:\n\u201cAdvanced retrieval infrastructure like Rockset will make AI apps more powerful and useful,\u201d he writes. \u201cRockset will become part of OpenAI and power the retrieval infrastructure backing OpenAI\u2019s product suite. We\u2019ll be helping OpenAI solve the hard database problems that AI apps face at massive scale.\u201d\nThe Rockset buy fits into OpenAI\u2019s broader recent strategy of investing heavily in its enterprise sales and tech orgs.\nIn May, OpenAI signed an agreement with PwC to resell OpenAI\u2019s tools to other businesses. The month before, the company launched a business-oriented custom model tuning and consulting program.\nThe moves appear to be paying dividends, with OpenAI\u2019s annualized revenue reportedly set to eclipse $3.4 billion this year. OpenAI recently disclosed that the enterprise tier of its viral AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT, had close to 600,000 users, which includes 93% of all Fortune 500 companies.\nRockset is only OpenAI\u2019s second public acquisition after Global Illumination, a New York-based startup tapping AI to build creative tools and infrastructure.\n\ntitle2:\nChange Healthcare confirms ransomware hackers stole medical records on a 'substantial proportion' of Americans\ndescription2:\nChange Healthcare has confirmed a February ransomware attack on its systems, which brought widespread disruption to the U.S. healthcare system for weeks and resulted in the theft of medical records affecting a \u201csubstantial proportion of people in America.\u201d\nIn a statement Thursday, Change Healthcare said it has begun the process of notifying affected individuals whose information was stolen during the cyberattack.\nThe health tech giant, owned by U.S. insurance conglomerate UnitedHealth Group, processes patient insurance and billing for thousands of hospitals, pharmacies and medical practices across the U.S. healthcare sector. As such, the company has access to massive amounts of health information on about a third of all Americans.\nThe cyberattack prompted the company to shut down its systems, resulting in outages and delays to thousands of healthcare providers who rely on Change, and affecting countless patients who could not obtain prescriptions or had medical care or procedures delayed.\nChange said in its latest statement that it \u201ccannot confirm exactly\u201d what data was stolen about each individual, and that the information may vary from person to person.\nThe affected information includes personal information, such as names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, as well as government identity documents, such as Social Security numbers, driver licenses and passport numbers.\nThe data also includes medical records and health information, such as diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, said Change. The hackers stole health insurance information, including plan and policy details, as well as billing, claims and payment information, which Change said includes financial and banking information.\nChange said it was still in the \u201clate stages\u201d of its review of the stolen data to determine what was taken and that more affected individuals may be identified. Some of the stolen information may relate to guarantors who paid healthcare bills for someone else, the company said.\nThe company added that affected individuals should receive notice by mail beginning late July.\nThe ransomware attack on Change Healthcare stands as one of the largest-ever known digital thefts of U.S. medical records. While the full impact of this data breach remains unclear, the ramifications for the millions of Americans whose private medical information was irretrievably compromised are likely incalculable.\nChange said it secured a copy of the stolen dataset in March to review for identifying and notifying affected individuals, which TechCrunch previously reported was obtained in exchange for paying a ransom demand.\nUnitedHealth confirmed it paid at least one ransom demand to the cybercriminal group behind the ransomware attack, known as ALPHV, in an effort to prevent the publication of the stolen files. Another hacking group called RansomHub demanded an additional payment from UnitedHealth after claiming ALPHV made off with the first ransom payment but left the stolen data with one of its affiliates \u2014 essentially a contractor \u2014 who broke in and deployed the ransomware on Change\u2019s systems.\nRansomHub subsequently published several files on its dark web leak site and threatened to sell the data to the highest bidder if another ransom wasn\u2019t paid.\nAccording to UnitedHealth chief executive Andrew Witty, the hackers broke into Change Healthcare\u2019s network using a set of stolen credentials to an internal system that was not protected with multi-factor authentication, a security feature that makes it more difficult for malicious hackers to misuse stolen passwords.\nThe ransomware attack cost UnitedHealth around $870 million in the first three months of the year, during which the company made $100 billion in revenue, according to the company\u2019s earnings report. UnitedHealth is expected to report its most recent earnings in mid-July.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta is tagging real photos as 'Made with AI,' say photographers\ndescription3:\nEarlier in February, Meta said that it would start labeling photos created with AI tools on its social networks. Since May, Meta has regularly tagged some photos with a \u201cMade with AI\u201d label on its Facebook, Instagram and Threads apps.\nBut the company\u2019s approach of labeling photos has drawn ire from users and photographers after attaching the \u201cMade with AI\u201d label to photos that have not been created using AI tools.\nThere are plenty of examples of Meta automatically attaching the label to photos that were not created through AI. For example, this photo of Kolkata Knight Riders winning the Indian Premier League Cricket tournament. Notably, the label is only visible on the mobile apps and not on the web.\nAn Instagram photo of the Kolkata Knight Riders, labeled as \u201cMade with AI.\u201d Image Credit: Instagram (screenshot)\nPlenty of other photographers have raised concerns over their images having been wrongly tagged with the \u201cMade with AI\u201d label. Their point is that simply editing a photo with a tool should not be subject to the label.\nFormer White House photographer Pete Souza said in an Instagram post that one of his photos was tagged with the new label. Souza told TechCrunch in an email that Adobe changed how its cropping tool works and you have to \u201cflatten the image\u201d before saving it as a JPEG image. He suspects that this action has triggered Meta\u2019s algorithm to attach this label.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s annoying is that the post forced me to include the \u2018Made with AI\u2019 even though I unchecked it,\u201d Souza told TechCrunch.\nA photo taken by Pete Souza, but which Instagram has labeled as \u201cMade with AI.\u201d Image Credit: Instagram (screenshot)\nMeta would not answer on the record to TechCrunch\u2019s questions about Souza\u2019s experience or other photographers\u2019 posts who said their posts were incorrectly tagged.\nIn a February blog post, Meta said it utilizes metadata of images to detect the label.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building industry-leading tools that can identify invisible markers at scale \u2014 specifically, the \u201cAI generated\u201d information in the C2PA and IPTC technical standards \u2014 so we can label images from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock as they implement their plans for adding metadata to images created by their tools,\u201d the company said at that time.\nAs PetaPixel reported last week, Meta seems to be applying the \u201cMade with AI\u201d label when photographers use tools such as Adobe\u2019s Generative AI Fill to remove objects.\nWhile Meta hasn\u2019t clarified when it automatically applies the label, some photographers have sided with Meta\u2019s approach, arguing that any use of AI tools should be disclosed.\nFor now, Meta provides no separate labels to indicate if a photographer used a tool to clean up their photo, or used AI to create it. For users, it might be hard to understand how much AI was involved in a photo. Meta\u2019s label specifies that \u201cGenerative AI may have been used to create or edit content in this post\u201d \u2014 but only if you tap on the label.\nDespite this approach, there are plenty of photos on Meta\u2019s platforms that are clearly AI-generated, and Meta\u2019s algorithm hasn\u2019t labeled them. With U.S. elections to be held in a few months, social media companies are under more pressure than ever to correctly handle AI-generated content.\n\ntitle4:\nUS government sanctions Kaspersky executives\ndescription4:\nThe U.S. government announced sanctions against 12 executives and senior leaders of the Russia-based cybersecurity giant Kaspersky.\nIn a press release, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said it designated the 12 company executives to protect internet users against malicious cyber threats.\n\u201cToday\u2019s action against the leadership of Kaspersky Lab underscores our commitment to ensure the integrity of our cyber domain and to protect our citizens against malicious cyber threats,\u201d Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson was quoted as saying in the press release. \u201cThe United States will take action where necessary to hold accountable those who would seek to facilitate or otherwise enable these activities.\u201d\nThe list of sanctioned individuals includes several Kaspersky board members, including Andrei Anatolyevich Efremov, who is also Kaspersky\u2019s chief business development officer, and Igor Gennadyevich Chekunov, who serves as the company\u2019s chief legal officer.\nAlso sanctioned are Kaspersky\u2019s global human resources chief Marina Mikhaylovna Alekseev, the company\u2019s head of communications Denis Vladimirovich Zenkin and chief technology officer Anton Mikhaylovich Ivanov, among others.\nOFAC noted that it did not sanction Kaspersky, its parent or subsidiary companies, nor the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Eugene Kaspersky.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking why CEO Kaspersky was not included in the sanctions. A Kaspersky spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment.\nToday\u2019s sanctions will make it more difficult for the named executives to start a new company, and it will effectively bar American customers and businesses from paying Kaspersky. Earlier this year, the U.S. government imposed similar sanctions against spyware maker Intellexa and its founder.\nKaspersky\u2019s executive corporate structure. Image Credits: U.S. Department of Treasury\nThe sanctions come a day after the U.S. government announced a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d ban on the sale of Kaspersky software in the United States, which will go into effect on July 20. Kaspersky will still be able to provide software updates to existing customers, but only until September 29. After that, U.S. customers who still use Kaspersky won\u2019t be able to get updates, which will render their antivirus software outdated and potentially unable to stop the latest cybersecurity threats.\nKaspersky\u2019s spokesperson Sawyer VanHorn said Thursday that the company would challenge the ban.\nThe U.S. government has for years taken actions against Kaspersky due to fears that it could be used as an instrument of Russian government influence, to help it hack U.S. targets or otherwise harm national security.\nIn September 2017, the Trump administration banned the use of the company\u2019s software in government agencies.
