Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

That's a shift from last year, when inflation-weary shoppers used the discount event to stock up on household essentials like pantry staples and office supplies.\nThe company had predicted U.S. shoppers would spend $14 billion online during the two-day event. Adobe tracks transactions not just on Amazon but also across a wide swath of U.S. retail sites. Amazon's Prime Day event, which ran Tuesday and Wednesday, has become a big revenue driver for other retailers, which often hold competing sales timed around Prime Day.\nAmazon said Thursday it also saw \"record-breaking\" Prime Day revenue, though it didn't disclose total sales from the event. The company touted its Rufus shopping assistant, which uses generative artificial intelligence to suggest products and give order updates, saying the tool \"helped millions\" of shoppers browse the site. Amazon last week made Rufus available to all U.S. users after testing it with a subset of shoppers.\nNumerator, which tracked purchases across more than 35,500 households, said shoppers spent more per order this year, with an average order size of $57.97, up from $54.05 during last year's event. Shoppers snapped up Amazon-branded Fire TV sticks, Premier protein shakes and Liquid IV packets, while home goods and household essentials, as well as apparel and shoes, were among the top categories, the firm found.\n\"Shoppers purchased fewer big-ticket items than we've seen in past years, and fewer participants placed multiple orders throughout the sale, indicating a shift to more conscious shopping and a preference for saving over splurging,\" Numerator analyst Amanda Schoenbauer said in a statement.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI 4o mini model announced\ndescription1:\nOpenAI announced it will launch a new AI model, \"GPT-4o mini,\" the artificial intelligence startup's latest effort to expand use of its popular chatbot, on Thursday.\nThe company called the new release \"the most capable and cost-efficient small model available today,\" and it plans to integrate image, video and audio into it later.\nThe mini AI model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, OpenAI's fastest and most powerful model, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for omni, and GPT-4o has improved audio, video and text capabilities, with the ability to handle 50 different languages at improved speed and quality, according to the company.\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.\nThe mini AI model announced Thursday is part of OpenAI's push to be at the forefront of \"multimodality,\" or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio and video, inside one tool: ChatGPT.\nLast year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC: \"The world is multimodal. If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things \u2014 the world is much bigger than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models are and what they can do.\"\nGPT-4o mini will be available on Thursday to free users of ChatGPT, along with ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers, and it will be available to ChatGPT Enterprise users next week, the company said in a press release.\n\ntitle2:\nUSPS shared customer postal addresses with Meta, LinkedIn and Snap\ndescription2:\nThe U.S. Postal Service was sharing the postal addresses of its online customers with advertising and tech giants Meta, LinkedIn and Snap, TechCrunch has found.\nOn Wednesday, the USPS said it addressed the issue and stopped the practice, claiming that it was \u201cunaware\u201d of it.\nTechCrunch found USPS was sharing customers\u2019 information by way of hidden data-collecting code (also known as tracking pixels) used across its website. Tech and advertising companies create this kind of code to collect information about the user \u2014 such as which pages they visit \u2014 every time a webpage containing the code loads in the customer\u2019s browser.\nIn the case of USPS, some of that collected data included the postal addresses of logged-in USPS Informed Delivery customers, who use the service to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long. Informed Delivery had more than 62 million users as of March 2024.\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, USPS spokesperson Jim McKean said: \u201cThe Postal Service leverages an analytics platform for our own internal purposes, so that we understand the usage of our products and services and which we use on an aggregated basis to market our products.\u201d\n\u201cThe Postal Service does not sell or provide any personal information that is collected from this analytics platform to any third party, and we were unaware of any configuration of the platform that collected personal information from the URL and that shared it without our knowledge with social media.\u201d\n\u201cWe have taken immediate action to remediate this issue,\u201d the spokesperson said, without saying what action was taken. The spokesperson declined to comment further.\nWhen reached for comment, Facebook spokesperson Emil Vazquez provided a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear in our policies that advertisers should not send sensitive information about people through our Business Tools. Doing so is against our policies, and we educate advertisers on properly setting up Business Tools to prevent this from occurring. Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.\u201d\nSpokespeople for LinkedIn and Snap did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch.\nIn our testing, TechCrunch discovered that the USPS website shared the postal address of a logged-in USPS Informed Delivery customer with Meta, LinkedIn and Snap. TechCrunch tested this by inspecting the network traffic using tools baked into most modern browsers.\nOur testing showed the data-collecting code on USPS\u2019 website was scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the companies.\nThe code also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, which appeared as partly pseudonymized \u2014 essentially scrambled in a way that makes it more difficult for humans to know where data came from, or who it relates to, by using randomized identifiers in place of real customer names. But researchers have long warned that pseudonymous data can still be used to re-identify seemingly anonymous individuals.\nTechCrunch also found that tracking numbers entered into the USPS website were also shared with advertisers and tech companies, including Bing, Google, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Snap. Some in-transit tracking data was also shared, such as the real-world location of the mail in the postal system, even if the customer was not logged in to USPS\u2019 website.\nUSPS\u2019 spokesperson declined to say if the postal service will ask the tech companies to delete the data that they collected.\nA spokesperson for the USPS Office of Inspector General, the federal watchdog that provides oversight of the postal service, did not comment at press time.\nUSPS is the latest organization in recent years to curtail its use of web tracking code.\nIn 2023, telehealth wellness startup Cerebral and alcohol recovery apps Tempest and Monument revealed they had shared private health information, including assessments submitted by their users, with tech and advertising companies, and had since removed the tracking code.\nIn the same year, the Federal Trade Commission brought enforcement action against healthcare data giant GoodRx, which agreed to pay $1.5 million for sharing health data of customers with advertisers, and online therapy company BetterHelp, which was ordered to compensate patients to the tune of $7.8 million for also sharing their private health questionnaire responses.\nUpdated with comment from Meta.\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia rebounds after TSMC says AI chip demand remains strong\ndescription3:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the Nvidia GTC Conference at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024.\nNvidia shares rose about 3% during trading on Thursday, rebounding one day after the stock plunged 7% on geopolitical concerns sparked by comments from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nNvidia's rise came after TSMC said on Thursday that demand remains high and supply remains constrained for high-end AI chips, which TSMC manufactures for Nvidia.\n\"I also try to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot. Today, the demand is so high I had to work very hard to meet customer demand,\" Wei told analysts.\n\"The supply continues to be pretty tight, all the way through 2025,\" TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei said on Thursday. The manufacturer reported revenue and net income higher than analyst expectations on Thursday, and the stock fell less than 1%.\nOn Wednesday, the semiconductor sector had its worst day since 2020, with big drops from AMD , Arm , Broadcom and Qualcomm alongside Nvidia. Chip stocks sunk on geopolitics concerns highlighted by comments from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump that he was considering a change to U.S. policy to not protect Taiwan from a Chinese invasion without payment. A Chinese invasion would throw Nvidia's chip supply into question.\n\"While there is rising concern over geopolitical tension given the upcoming US presidential election, TSMC mentioned that it would continue its overseas expansion to mitigate the risks,\" Citi analyst Laura Chen wrote in a note on Thursday. TSMC is currently constructing a large chip factory in Arizona, partially funded by U.S. subsidies.\nOther chipmakers still struggled. Arm was down 2%, AMD fell 2%, and Qualcomm was flat. Super Micro Computer, a key server assembler for Nvidia, fell 2%.\nIntel rose over 1%, and Broadcom was up about 3% after a report that said it was in talks to produce AI chips for OpenAI.\nBloomberg reported on Wednesday that the Biden administration is considering further trade restrictions on shipping chip manufacturing equipment to China. ASML, a Dutch company which makes the machines that TSMC uses to make chips, was off 1% after it reported light sales guidance for the current quarter on Thursday.\nUBS analysts wrote in a Thursday note that investors are taking gains from strong semiconductor performers and reallocating them into other shares, although forthcoming commentary later this year on how companies are making a return on investment on AI chips may spur the sector higher again. Nvidia stock is up more than 150% so far in 2024.\n\"Following sharp semiconductor sector outperformance in the first half, some investors have rebalanced AI-linked semiconductor exposure into large-cap platform and profitless tech companies,\" UBS analysts wrote in the note.\n\ntitle4:\nElon Musk is now a villain in Joe Biden's presidential campaign\ndescription4:\nElon Musk has made it clear he doesn\u2019t like Joe Biden. But since Musk officially endorsed and is reportedly financially backing Donald Trump in this year\u2019s presidential campaign, Biden is returning the favor. The president is now directly campaigning on Musk \u2014 and other high-profile and wealthy Silicon Valley VCs \u2014 supporting Trump\u2019s bid.\n\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d Biden wrote on Musk\u2019s social media site X on Wednesday after testing positive for COVID, before revealing a bait-and-switch in the next post: \u201cof Elon Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election.\u201d\nHours earlier, Biden\u2019s campaign sent out a fundraising text saying that \u201cthe richest person in the world is now on Team MAGA\u201d and accused Musk of \u201cusing his fortune to try to control our democracy.\u201d\nBiden centering Musk in his campaign is a notable escalation, considering he spent most of his presidency seemingly pretending the billionaire didn\u2019t exist \u2014 like when he famously held an \u201cEV Summit\u201d in 2021 where Tesla wasn\u2019t invited; or when he said that Detroit \u2014 not Tesla \u2014 was \u201cleading the world in electric vehicles.\u201d\nCampaigning against Musk\u2019s involvement is a gamble given the billionaire\u2019s sway over Silicon Valley and the tech industry, in general. A swath of Silicon Valley\u2019s richest are backing the super PAC Musk is reportedly contributing to, including Sequoia Capital partners Shaun Maguire and Doug Leone. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz announced they will financially support Trump\u2019s campaign largely due to the presidential candidate\u2019s support for crypto, stance on AI as well as Biden\u2019s proposal to tax unrealized capital gains. Musk confidant David Sacks has been leading the charge to drum up even more support for Trump, not just on X but also in the real world, as he spoke onstage this week at the Republican National Convention.\nOf course, with Biden\u2019s campaign under threat, it\u2019s possible he may not see much downside to putting a spotlight on Musk\u2019s involvement. After all, Musk, Sacks and other power players like Peter Thiel were already animated enough to push Trump to pick JD Vance as his vice presidential nominee before Biden made the Tesla CEO a focus of his campaigning. And the super PAC many of these people are piling money into was formed in June.\nWhether Biden slighted Musk because of his anti-union stance, or his embrace of far-right policies, almost doesn\u2019t matter. Being ignored clearly bothered Musk \u2014 he brings it up a lot.\nMusk interacted with the Trump administration in a few ways, including serving on his economic advisory council, but he had never outright supported him as a candidate.\nMeanwhile, Musk has benefited materially from and during Biden\u2019s presidency. The Inflation Reduction Act set Tesla (and its battery partner Panasonic) up to $41 billion in credits by 2032. Tesla hit its highest valuation ever in 2021 amid the broader wave of EV optimism (and after Hertz promised a large bulk purchase of Musk\u2019s cars). SpaceX and its satellite business Starlink has been a repeat winner of defense and other government contracts. And he did ultimately end up meeting with Biden at the White House in September 2023.\nBut his companies are also facing multiple federal investigations, some of which started during Biden\u2019s presidency. He\u2019s clearly more ideologically aligned with Trump, and there are reasons to believe his companies would continue to benefit from another Trump presidency.\nBiden embracing anti-Musk rhetoric as a result is already helping him financially: On Thursday afternoon, Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg wrote on X that the post calling out \u201cMusk and his rich buddies\u201d was \u201cthe second best raising social post\u201d for the campaign in more than a year.\"\n\nResponse:",
