 TikTok faces a ban in the US, Tesla profits drop and healthcare data leaks
Welcome, folks, to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch’s regular newsletter covering this week’s noteworthy happenings in tech.
TikTok’s fate in the U.S. looks uncertain after President Joe Biden signed a bill that included a deadline for ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, to divest itself of TikTok within nine months or face a ban on distributing it in the U.S. Ivan writes about how the impact of TikTok bans in other countries could signal what’s to come stateside.
Meanwhile, fallout from the Change Healthcare hack continues. Change, a subsidiary of health insurance giant UnitedHealth, confirmed this week that the ransomware attack targeting it earlier this year resulted in a huge theft of Americans’ private health info, possibly covering “a substantial proportion” of Americans.
And Tesla profits dropped 55% as the EV company contends with increased pressure from hybrid carmakers. The automaker’s growth plan is centered around mysterious cheaper EVs scheduled to launch next year — as well as perhaps a robotaxi. But a recall on the Cybertruck for faulty accelerator pedals certainly won’t help in the interim.
Lots else happened. We recap it all in this edition of WiR — but first, a reminder to sign up to receive the WiR newsletter in your inbox every Saturday.

Digital ad market on mend as Meta, Alphabet, Snap show faster growth
Advertising is so back.
After a brutal 2022, when brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation, and a 2023 defined by layoffs and cost cuts, the top digital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip.
Meta , Snap and Google all reported first-quarter results this week, with revenue growth that exceeded analysts estimates and at rates not seen in at least two years. Their financials were primarily driven by improvements across their ad businesses.
The companies entered earnings season in a favorable position in that their numbers would be comparable to historically weak periods. But investors and analysts were cautious in their expectations, given the political and economic instability in various markets across the globe and the ongoing challenges posed by high consumer prices.
Meta, which was the first in the group to report results, put some fears to rest on Wednesday, showing a 27% jump in first-quarter revenue to $36.5 billion. For the Facebook parent, it was the strongest rate of expansion since 2021.
"When Meta was in its dark days two years ago, the company knew what they had to do to get back on track," analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note after the earnings report. "To their credit, Meta defended the core."
That dark era was defined by the combination of macroeconomic challenges and Apple's iOS privacy change, which made it harder for social media companies to target users with ads. Meta lost two-thirds of its value in 2022 and was forced to dramatically cut headcount.

The Apple Vision Pro’s eBay prices are making me sad
I paid a lot of money for the privilege of getting an Apple Vision Pro brand-new in February. All-in, with optical inserts and taxes, I financed a little over $3,900 for the 256GB version of the headset. A day or so ago, I made a mistake that I’m sure many early adopters are familiar with: I looked up how much it’s been selling for on eBay.
On Wednesday, a 1TB Vision Pro, complete with all the included gear, Apple’s fluffy $200 travel case, $500 AppleCare Plus, and claimed to have been “worn maybe about an hour” sold for $3,200 after 21 bids. The listed shipping estimate was $20.30. Brand new, that combination is $5,007.03 on Apple’s site for me. Another eBay listing, this one with my headset’s configuration (but sans optical inserts) went for just $2,600 — again with most, if not all, of the included accessories. Several other 256GB and 512GB models sold for around that amount this week.
The story is no different over on Swappa, a popular reselling site among Apple users:
Look at those deep discounts. Screenshot: Wes Davis / The Verge
This, of course, is how the story goes for early adopters, especially when you’re buying very expensive tech before the mainstream catches on. Apple’s pricing doesn’t help matters, especially when the next closest competing headset — the Meta Quest 3 — is just $500. It’s a bummer even if they’re ultimately not all that comparable, at least in terms of their targeted audiences and goals for their platforms.
But it still stings, doesn’t it? Knowing I could have saved several hundred dollars and gotten the highest storage configuration, AppleCare Plus, and a storage case is particularly painful. I like the Vision Pro plenty — maybe more than any other writer at The Verge — but if I hadn’t missed the return window, I would send mine right back to Apple in a heartbeat just so I could get one of these deals. Thankfully, when I’m wearing the headset, nobody can see my tears.

Will a TikTok ban impact creator economy startups? Not really, founders say
Will a TikTok ban impact creator economy startups? Not really, founders say ‘Two years ago, this would have been devastating’
President Joe Biden signed a bill on Wednesday that could ban TikTok – for real this time. After so many false starts and stops, some creator economy founders and their clients are rolling their eyes. They’ve been through this before.
“I think two years ago, this would have been devastating,” Karat Financial co-founder and co-CEO Eric Wei told TechCrunch. “Now… Eh.”
When creators succeed, the startups that work in the creator economy generally succeed as well. Still, Wei isn’t particularly concerned that the friction from a TikTok ban would impact his business, a Series B startup that provides financial services to creators.
“If you build products in startups that help creators make money, then actually, from an addressable market point of view, this is good for you,” Wei said. “Your framing can be like, ‘TikTok is gone, as a creator, you need to be thinking about diversifying and how to support yourself, so here’s XYZ things you can do.’”
The threat of the TikTok ban feels a bit like “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” even though this time, it’s different. This isn’t just political theater in the form of ongoing Senate hearings. This bill, which would force ByteDance to sell TikTok if it can’t find an American buyer within nine months, made its way through the House and the Senate to Biden’s desk, where he signed it into law.
But the creator landscape looks different now than it did in 2020, when former President Donald Trump tried banning the Chinese-owned app (and, as he runs for president again, he now says he’s opposed to the ban, because it would give Meta too much power). Established creators have had about three years of legal back-and-forth and two different presidencies to prepare their businesses for a world without TikTok.
As Wei scrolls through a large group chat he’s in with other creators, he notes that no one’s too panicked.
“I’m looking through, and there’s some jokes – one guy jokes, ‘My Snapchat shares are about to pop,’ and another said, ‘Let’s make a skit: when TikTokers protest the TikTok ban – who’s in?’” he said. “A third says, ‘TikTok’s about to sue, I’ve been talking with their internals,’ and a fourth one replied, ‘Where’s my popcorn?’”
This isn’t the case for all kinds of creators. Wei notes that TikTok livestreamers and creators that monetize via TikTok Shop could be hit the hardest, since platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels aren’t as invested in those features as TikTok. The ban could also be detrimental to politically-oriented creators, since Instagram Reels isn’t a viable alternative for them – the Meta-owned platform has begun limiting the reach of political content. And while the more established creators in Wei’s group chat have been preparing for this for years, the transition away from TikTok could be a huge gut-punch to newer creators who don’t have followings on multiple platforms yet.
“To be clear, no one’s like, ‘This is good for us!” Wei said. But the amount of time creators have had to prepare for this moment has made them better poised to weather the storm.
“This is something that’s been talked about for a very long time, so creators are aware – this is not new,” Harry Gestetner, co-founder and CEO of creator monetization platform Fanfix, told TechCrunch. “The second thing is, this is not an overnight ban. Creators still have about a year to transfer their following, so I am optimistic.”
James Jones – the CEO of Bump, another financial services company for creators – is looking at the situation in parallel.
“There will undoubtedly be a ripple effect amongst the creator community as a result of the TikTok ban,” Jones told TechCrunch. “But creators are getting better at diversifying the ways that they monetize across multiple platforms. We’ve also seen this movie before in the case of Vine, which paved the way for TikTok to fill the void that it left.”
TikTok’s secret sauce is its power to help creators get discovered – more so than other platforms, anyone can blow up on the For You Page. But while Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could have been likened to “Kirkland brand TikTok” in 2021, the platforms have since matured.
In TikTok’s initial Creator Fund, a static pool of money distributed among a growing number of eligible creators, few people were supporting themselves on TikTok views alone. This has only recently changed as TikTok transitioned creators into its Creativity Program, which offers a better deal to eligible creators – but not all creators are making videos that fit the bill for that program. So, to make content creation a stable career, they’d have to transition onto other platforms anyway. YouTube Shorts has started sharing ad revenue on short-form videos, similar to its longstanding Partner Program, while Instagram Reels only has occasional, unreliable bonus programs.
Gestetner told TechCrunch that some creators he works with have been disillusioned by TikTok anyway.
“The problems with TikTok go past just the ban,” he said. “Creators so often get their accounts removed on TikTok, or get shadow banned, or get reported, and it’s very difficult to get an answer from TikTok. So we’ve dealt with problems there for years now.”
It’s not as though other platforms don’t share these transparency issues. But these risks have made it essential for creators to not put all their energy into one platform.
“Five years ago, creators were generally on one platform,” he said. “Now, every creator has a minimum of three, and up to five, six or seven platforms they use.”
This necessity of diversification extends beyond just the platforms creators use. Creators also need to generate income from a variety of sources, whether that be through fan memberships, product sales, live performances or courses.
“I think on our business, there will be no impact, or potentially kind of a positive impact,” Gestetner said. “It helps our case, because creators are all skeptical of the big platforms, and they don’t want all of their monetization to be tied to a particular platform.”
In theory, the ban on TikTok could create room in the market for another short-form video app – perhaps one that is not owned by a massive corporation like Meta or Google. But this likely won’t pose another situation like what happened when Elon Musk bought Twitter, and several microblogging apps cropped up seemingly overnight.
“I think a really good example of this is like, remember Triller?” Wei said. “For a while, we were all excited about it, like ‘Oh my god, TikTok’s going away, let’s put money toward Triller!’ But then everyone realized TikTok is not going away. And now it’s years later, and does anyone talk about Triller anymore?”
Well, they might not be talking about Triller either because the company is a walking red flag. In any case, creators won’t have the patience to invest in a nascent platform that might not last, so they’ll have to make due with Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat. That doesn’t mean TikTok won’t be missed, though.
“I think the fans will be affected the most overall,” Gestetner said. “But I do think the Shorts experience and Reels experience is getting very good.”

A wrestling match over who should control robotaxis is playing out in California
A wrestling match over who should control robotaxis is playing out in California The state could set the standard for autonomous vehicle regulation, but in the process could push away Cruise, Waymo, Zoox and others
Cities around the country have long been crying out for more control over how autonomous vehicles are deployed on their streets. In California, they might finally get their wish.
A handful of AV-related bills, which made progress this month in their long journey through the state legislature, could put more restrictions on companies like Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox.
One bill, SB 915, stands out because it could give cities more power to set their own rules around robotaxis — things like hours of operation and appropriate pickup and drop-off locations. The bill, which passed the Senate Transportation Committee this week, is one of several laws that have been introduced in California this year dedicated to putting guardrails on the pioneer technology.
The stakes are high for just about everyone.
California, which is the fifth-largest economy in the world, must thread the regulatory needle to protect its residents without losing the kind of next-generation companies that have helped turn the state into a hub of tech talent. Waymo and Cruise, both of which are headquartered in California, risk more red tape that could hinder expansion — a key factor to achieving profitability. City officials, and the people they represent, are fighting for a say in how this all plays out.
Harsher rules could influence other states to take similar measures — a path that played out with California’s rules on vehicle emissions standards. It could have a counter-effect as well.
“To go city by city and make your case when you have like 500 cities in California all applying slightly different standards, it’s really hard to understand why companies would subject themselves to that, especially when you have a lot of states on the other end that are also large population centers,” Jeff Farrah, CEO of advocacy group Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA), told TechCrunch. “And they’re saying, ‘Hey, we want you to come. We think AVs can solve a lot of problems.'”
It is still early days for the handful of AV bills, all of which must go through a lengthy legislative process and could be vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Here’s an explainer of the bills, where they are in the process, and what it might mean for companies and the public.
SB 915 — Giving local governments more power over AVs
Author/co-author: State senator Dave Cortese (D) | Assembly member Freddie Rodriguez (D)
Sponsors: California Teamsters and the California League of Cities.
Cortese introduced SB 915 on April 17. The bill passed the Senate Transportation Committee on April 23. It will go on to the Appropriations Committee and, if passed, will make it to the Senate floor.
What is SB 915?
“The bill allows governments to weigh in on the operations of autonomous vehicle services, or AVs, in their communities,” Senator Cortese, whose District 15 includes much of Silicon Valley, said last week when introducing the bill. “Currently AV operations are approved or denied at the state level by the [Department of Motor Vehicles] or the [Public Utilities Commission]. Though they hold proceedings to gather public input, there’s no guarantee that the state will consider local concerns.”
Under SB 915, when a state agency like the DMV or the CPUC approves AV operations, local governments would be able to pass ordinances to regulate the vehicles within their jurisdictions.
For instance, cities would have the power to regulate hours of operation or how many vehicles could be on the road at any given time. Cities would be able to create their own, separate permitting processes and penalties for AVs that break local traffic laws. They would also be able to form coalitions with other local governments to collaboratively regulate services.
Important to note: The bill’s language stipulates that if a local government doesn’t get around to creating ordinances (because many local departments are understaffed and overworked), the default guidelines fall back to whatever the state has approved.
SB 915 would also require all AV commercial passenger service companies to be compliant with disability access laws, provide an override system for emergency responders and train emergency responders on how to manually override the vehicles.
A patchwork of regulations
Those against SB 915, which include the lobbying group Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA), various Chambers of Commerce, and other tech and business industry groups, expressed concern that creating such a patchwork of local regulations would make compliance challenging for companies and restrict innovation.
“Cities are very limited in terms of the types of things they can be involved with, things like speed limits and local law enforcement,” said Farrah. “And so for human-driven vehicles, there has not been a very strong role for cities in terms of regulation. And that’s something we think should be applied in the autonomous vehicle world. It’s not fair to me at all that autonomous vehicles would be singled out for this type of action.”
Speaking to TechCrunch in a phone interview, Cortese challenged the argument:
This is the culture and system we have now for vehicles in this state in terms of vehicle regulation, so I feel like, if this was sitting on my Apple home screen, we just drag AVs into the current scheme. The CPUC is going to continue to regulate your rates. The DMV does your overarching permitting and registration. And then local governments are gonna do the more finessed thing that they do and let you know where to drop people off and pick people up at the airport, let you know where there are safe routes to schools and if there are certain loading zones that are not okay for AVs.
There is already precedent for this kind of regulation.
Cities and towns already have the ability to set their own regulations on many transportation-related issues, such as the operation of vehicles for hire, a category that robotaxis certainly fall under, according to the California Vehicle Code. Cities can also regulate traffic at construction sites, move vehicles parked in fire lanes and establish maximum speed limits.
“And [local governments] meet every week,” said Cortese. “This is the part about industry resistance I haven’t fully wrapped my mind around. As a business person myself, I’d rather have the nimbleness of local government to deal with on these nuts-and-bolts issues than the state of California, this massive bureaucratic, bicameral system that only comes out once a year.”
Cortese said he understands industry concerns that giving localities more power would threaten the ability of AVs to operate there. However, he noted that the bill doesn’t give cities the right to ban driverless vehicles.
“On a fundamental basis, what we’re trying to communicate to elected officials — who are put there by the people — is that we should not outsource the decisions on how AI technology is deployed, including autonomous vehicles, to the very corporations that are creating that technology because those people are going to achieve the benefits,” Peter Finn, Western Region VP of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, told TechCrunch in a phone interview. “If we put all the decision-making in the hands of corporations, they’re going to try to maximize shareholder value.”
To Finn’s point, the AVIA recently published its TRUST principles, an industry standard for how AV companies should safely expand operations in communities in the U.S., including recommendations on transparency, engagement with communities, cybersecurity and privacy standards, and more. The principles act both as guidelines to companies and as a statement to governments that the AV industry is perfectly capable of regulating itself, thank you very much.
The rest of California’s autonomous vehicle pipeline
AB 2286 is a revival of AB 316, the bill that would require human safety operators to be in the driver’s seat of autonomous heavy-duty vehicles. In November 2023, Gov. Newsom vetoed the bill despite overwhelming support for it, which is why Assembly members Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (D), Laura Friedman (D) and Ash Kalra (D) reintroduced it in February.
The revived bill passed the Senate Committee on Transportation on April 15 and has been re-referred to the Committee on Communications and Conveyance.
The Committee on Transportation voted April 22 to progress AB 1777, which would amend the current vehicle code as it relates to AVs. The bill, which Assembly member Phil Ting (D) introduced in January, asks the manufacturer to certify that the AV can respond to and comply with defined geofencing protocols. It also requires the manufacturer to clearly display a working phone number on the AV that is monitored at all times to enable communication between the companies and law enforcement, emergency responders and traffic control officers.
AB 1777, like SB 915, also opens the door to fining AV manufacturers if a vehicle operating without a human driver commits an infraction.
Farrah told TechCrunch that the AV industry never assumed that self-driving commercial cars would be exempt from ticketing for traffic violations. He pointed out that most other states with AV regulation, excluding California, assume the vehicle manufacturer is the driver, and therefore liable, when no human driver is present.
AB 1777 would also require AV manufacturers to compile and submit quarterly reports to the DMV summarizing the activity of their vehicles. If manufacturers fail to do this, the bill authorizes the DMV to either fully suspend or revoke a testing permit, or else incrementally enforce measures that limit where vehicles can operate, how fast, under which weather conditions and more.
The last bill making its way through California’s legislature is AB 3061, which would require AV manufacturers to provide more robust reporting to the DMV by July 31, 2025. Today, AV companies must report collisions to the DMV and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but this bill would make them report traffic violations and disengagements, as well as any incident of discrimination or barrier to access for a passenger with a disability.
Manufacturers would need to submit detailed reports at the time of any incident, as well as regular reports that include vehicle miles traveled, unplanned stops and wheelchair-accessible services.
AB 3061 would also require the DMV, as well as other agencies like the CPUC and the Department of California Highway Patrol, to create and publish regular AV incident forms and reports that would be available to the public. If companies fail to adhere to reporting provisions, the DMV would have the authority to impose fines or suspend or revoke permits. Members of the public with direct evidence of an incident would also be given a path to submit AV incident reports.

我是wall-e，欢迎来到ai简报。tiktok在美国面临禁令的风险日益增加，此事发生在乔·拜登总统签署了一项法案后，该法案规定tiktok的母公司字节跳动必须在九个月内剥离tiktok，否则将面临在美国分发禁令。与此同时，change healthcare黑客攻击事件的后续影响持续发酵。作为美国健康保险巨头unitedhealth的子公司，change本周确认，今年早些时候针对其进行的勒索软件攻击导致大量美国人的私人健康信息被盗，可能涉及“大量”美国人。另外，随着特斯拉与混合动力汽车制造商的竞争加剧，其利润下降了55%。该汽车制造商的增长计划主要围绕明年推出的更便宜的电动车——以及可能的机器人出租车。但cybertruck因油门踏板故障而被召回，这显然不会有所帮助。

除了这些，还有更多发生。本周，亚马逊在美国推出了新的无限量杂货送货订阅服务。对亚马逊prime用户，该计划每月费用为9.99美元，涵盖了亚马逊fresh、全食超市以及其他当地杂货零售商超过35美元的订单免费送货。在另一个关于亚马逊的消息中，该科技巨头确认将结束在加利福尼亚州洛克福德的prime air无人机送货业务。该镇是继德克萨斯州的科利奇站之后，该公司在美国的第二个无人机送货站点；亚马逊没有提供任何关于此次挫折的详细信息。电动汽车初创企业fisker表示，计划在两个月前裁员15%之后，将进行更多裁员，因为该初创企业争取筹集资金以维持运营。

stripe在旧金山的sessions会议上宣布了一系列其他公告，表示它将从其其他金融服务堆栈中分离出支付部分。考虑到stripe此前要求企业成为其支付客户才能使用其任何其他产品，这是一个重大变化。

还有更多的分析和评论，包括对ai诗歌、实验室制造的钻石等主题的探讨，以及对数字广告市场恢复的观察，meta、alphabet、snap展示了更快的增长。但是，假如tiktok被禁止，对创作者经济初创企业的影响可能并不大，至少创始人们这么说。尽管如此，加利福尼亚正在上演一场关于谁应该控制机器人出租车的角力赛。

这就是今天的全部内容。我们明天见。
