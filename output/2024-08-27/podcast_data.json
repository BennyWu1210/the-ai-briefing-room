Ann Wang | Reuters\nFor Nvidia investors, the past two years have been a joyride. But recently they've been on more of a roller coaster. As the primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, Nvidia has seen its market cap expand by about ninefold since the end of 2022. But after reaching a record in June and briefly becoming the world's most valuable public company, Nvidia proceeded to lose almost 30% of its value over the next seven weeks, shedding roughly $800 billion in market cap. Now, it's in the midst of a rally that's pushed the stock within about 6% of its all-time high. With the chipmaker set to report quarterly results Wednesday, the stock's volatility is top of mind for Wall Street. Any indication that AI demand is waning or that a leading cloud customer is modestly tightening its belt potentially translates into significant revenue slippage. \"It's the most important stock in the world right now,\" EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" last week. \"If they lay an egg, it would be a major problem for the whole market. I think they're going to surprise to the upside.\" Nvidia's report comes weeks after its megacap tech peers got through earnings. The company's name was sprinkled throughout those analyst calls, as Microsoft , Alphabet , Meta , Amazon and Tesla all spend heavily on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train AI models and run massive workloads.\nwatch now\nIn Nvidia's past three quarters, revenue has more than tripled on an annual basis, with the vast majority of growth coming from the data center business. Analysts expect a fourth straight quarter of triple-digit growth, but at a reduced pace of 112% to $28.7 billion, according to LSEG. From here, year-over-year comparisons get much tougher, and growth is expected to slow in each of the next six quarters. Investors will be paying particularly close attention to Nvidia's forecast for the October quarter. The company is expected to show growth of about 75% to $31.7 billion. Optimistic guidance will suggest that Nvidia's deep-pocketed clients are signaling an ongoing willingness to open their wallets for the AI build-out, while a disappointing forecast could raise concern that infrastructure spending has gotten frothy. \"Given the steep increase in hyperscale capex over the past 18 months and the strong near-term outlook, investors frequently question the sustainability of the current capex trajectory,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs, who recommend buying the stock, wrote in a note last month. Much of the optimism heading into the report \u2014 the stock is up almost 10% in August \u2014 is due to comments from top customers about how much they're continuing to shell out for data centers and Nvidia-based infrastructure. The shares rose 1.5% on Tuesday to close at $128.30. Last month, the CEOs of Google and Meta enthusiastically endorsed the pace of their build-outs and said underinvesting was a greater risk than overspending. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently told students at Stanford, in a video that was later removed, that he was hearing from top tech companies \"they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion\" worth of processors. But while Nvidia's profit margin has been expanding of late, the company still faces questions about the long-term return on investment that clients will see from their purchases of devices that cost tens of thousands of dollars each and are being ordered in bulk. During Nvidia's last earnings call in May, CFO Colette Kress provided data points suggesting that cloud providers, which account for more than 40% of Nvidia's revenue, would generate $5 in revenue for every $1 spent on Nvidia chips over four years. More such stats are likely on the way. Last month, Goldman analysts wrote, following a meeting with Kress, that the company would share further ROI metrics this quarter \"to instill confidence in investors.\"\nBlackwell timing\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., displays the new Blackwell GPU chip during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference on March 18, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nThe other major question facing Nvidia is the timeline for its next-generation AI chips, dubbed Blackwell. The Information reported earlier this month that the company is facing production issues, which will likely push big shipments back into the first quarter of 2025. Nvidia said at the time that production was on track to ramp in the second half of the year. The report came after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang surprised investors and analysts in May by saying the company will see \"a lot\" of Blackwell revenue this fiscal year. While Nvidia's current generation of chips, called Hopper, remain the premium option for deploying AI applications like ChatGPT, competition is popping up from Advanced Micro Devices , Google and a smattering of startups, which is pressuring Nvidia to maintain its performance lead through a smooth upgrade cycle. Even with a potential Blackwell delay, that revenue could just get pushed back into a future quarter while boosting current Hopper sales, especially the newer H200 chip. The first Hopper chips were in full production in September 2022. \"That shift in timing doesn't matter very much, as supply and customer demand has rapidly pivoted to H200,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note this week. Many of Nvidia's leading customers say they need the additional processing power of Blackwell chips in order to train more advanced next-generation AI models. But they'll take what they can get. \"We expect Nvidia to deemphasize its Blackwell B100/B200 GPU allocation in favor of ramping up its Hopper H200s in\" the second half of the year, HSBC analyst Frank Lee wrote in a August note. He has a buy rating on the stock. Correction: Colette Kress is CFO of Nvidia. An earlier version misspelled her name.\n\ntitle1:\nBuy now, pay later firm Klarna swings to first-half profit ahead of IPO\ndescription1:\nKlarna said it posted a profit in the first half of the year, swinging into the black from a loss last year as the buy now, pay later pioneer edges closer toward its hotly anticipated stock market debut.\nIn results published Tuesday, Klarna said that it made an adjusted operating profit of 673 million Swedish krona ($66.1 million) in the six months through June 2024, up from a loss of 456 million krona in the same period a year ago. Revenue, meanwhile, grew 27% year-on-year to 13.3 billion krona.\nOn a net income basis, Klarna reported a 333 million Swedish krona loss. However, Klarna cites adjusted operating income as its primary metric for profitability as it better reflects \"underlying business activity.\"\nKlarna is one of the biggest players in the so-called buy now, pay later sector. Alongside peers PayPal , Block 's Afterpay, and Affirm , these companies give consumers the option to pay for purchases via interest-free monthly installments, with merchants covering the cost of service via transaction fees.\nSebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and co-founder, said the company saw strong revenue growth in the U.S. in particular, where sales jumped 38% thanks to a ramp-up in merchant onboarding.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta and Instagram spotted developing a new social music-sharing feature\ndescription2:\nMeta and Spotify are exploring deeper music integration in Meta\u2019s Instagram app. New findings indicate the companies are testing a feature that would allow users to continuously share what music they\u2019re listening to through Instagram\u2019s Notes.\nThe new functionality was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they\u2019re still under development. However, companies like Meta and Spotify test new concepts all the time, so the discovery doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the feature will launch to the public in the near future.\nIn a screenshot Paluzzi published on Meta\u2019s Threads, he shows a new option that would allow someone to \u201ccontinuously share\u201d their music from Spotify, as opposed to selecting a song from Instagram\u2019s catalog.\n\u201cYou can stop sharing at any time,\u201d the message also indicates.\nIf it launches, the addition would build on a development launched a little over a year ago, when Instagram added the ability to share 30-second song clips to Notes. Introduced in 2022, Notes allow Instagram users to share their status or other quick updates in a message that appears right above their Instagram inbox. The song clips feature in Notes has been supported in all markets worldwide where Instagram has music licensing rights, the company said at the time of its introduction.\nA partnership with Spotify could automate these sorts of song postings, providing Instagram with content even when its users were actively engaged with another app.\nThe feature is reminiscent of the social networking activity that\u2019s currently available within Spotify\u2019s app. Today, Spotify allows users to \u201cconnect with Facebook\u201d to see what friends are streaming in a separate tab on its desktop app. Spotify has also tested a Community feature that would allow users to see in real-time what others were streaming on mobile, although that has yet to launch.\nAlthough Spotify has continued to add more social features over time, most recently with commenting on podcasts and richer user profiles, the company understands that music discovery still often takes place on dedicated social networking apps where people have built their friend networks and more regularly check in.\nThere have been other indications of a Meta-Spotify tie-up, too. Technologist Chris Messina told TechCrunch that at some point over the past several weeks, Instagram had added a \u201cSpotifyiOS.framework\u201d component to its app. He estimated this was around the release of Instagram version v.338.0 over a month ago.\nEarlier, Messina had pointed to another feature that would allow Instagram users to add music to their profile ahead of the official launch of the feature last week in collaboration with singer Sabrina Carpenter. Messina theorized that Instagram could eventually integrate the offering with Spotify to better challenge TikTok on music discovery.\nMeta and Spotify are no strangers to working together on music features. In 2021, they teamed up on music initiatives that included a miniplayer on Facebook that streamed Spotify directly from the app. The companies also now share a common enemy in Apple. Both Spotify and Meta believe that Apple\u2019s App Store monopoly prevents them from managing their own in-app payments and handling their own app distribution, instead requiring them to share their app revenue with Apple via commissions on in-app purchases. Plus, Apple\u2019s addition of a privacy feature called ATT, or app tracking transparency, hurt Meta\u2019s ads business, while Apple Music is a direct competitor with Spotify.\nSpotify and Meta did not respond to requests for comment.\n\ntitle3:\nOne busted valve led to the failure of Astrobotic's $108M Peregrine lunar lander mission\ndescription3:\nAstrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lunar lander failed to reach the moon because of a problem with a single valve in the propulsion system, according to a report on the mission released Tuesday. Company leadership said in a press conference that engineers have redesigned the valve and introduced additional redundancy into the propulsion system of its next lander, Griffin, to ensure the problem doesn\u2019t reoccur.\nThe report comes from a review board assembled shortly after the Peregrine mission concluded in January. That mission encountered trouble just hours after launch on January 8, when engineers activated the spacecraft\u2019s propulsion system for the first time on orbit.\nAt that point, the fuel and oxidizer tanks should\u2019ve been pressurized with helium, upon the opening of two pressure control valves, or PCVs. But helium began to flow \u201cuncontrollably\u201d through the second valve into the oxidizer tank, Astrobotic CEO John Thornton explained during the press conference.\n\u201cThat caused a significant and rapid over-pressurization of the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the tank then ruptured and subsequently leaked oxidizer for the remainder of the mission.\u201d\nThat PCV was unable to reseal, likely due to a mechanical failure caused by \u201cvibration-induced relaxation\u201d between some threaded components inside the valve, the review board\u2019s chair John Horack said. Telemetry data was able to pinpoint the location and timing of the anomaly, and this data was consistent with the autonomous sequence to open and close the PCV, and the position of the valve on the propulsion system. Engineers were also able to replicate the failure in ground testing.\nWhile the oxidizer leak continued, Astrobotic\u2019s team was able to stabilize the spacecraft, charge its batteries, and power its payloads. But the issue was ultimately fatal to the mission, and after 10.5 days, the spacecraft returned to Earth and burned up in the atmosphere.\nThe 34-person review board included 26 people internal to the company and eight from outside. The board reviewed not just the data collected during the mission, but also all the data from the flight qualification campaign and component testing. In the end, it determined that the likely cause of the malfunction was the failure of that single helium PCV in the propulsion system.\nThe board also compiled a timeline of events that led to the failure, and it starts all the way back in 2019, when Astrobotic contracted an unnamed vendor for the development of the propulsion feed system. When that vendor started suffering technical and supply chain issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Astrobotic made the decision in early 2022 to terminate their contract and finish the partly assembled feed system in-house.\n\u201cBy this time, we\u2019d already made the decision to do Griffin\u2019s propulsion system in-house, to do more vertical integration,\u201d Astrobotic\u2019s mission director Sharad Bhaskaran said. \u201cWe\u2019d already developed a lot of the capabilities to do that propulsion integration. \u2026 This also burned down some of the risk going into the Griffin program, which is far more complex than Peregrine.\u201d\nAstrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander on orbit. Image Credits: Astrobotic (opens in a new window)\nBut Astrobotic engineers started encountering issues with the original vendor\u2019s propulsion components \u2014 in particular the PCVs. In August 2022, they switched to a different, unnamed PCV supplier, and those valves were installed on the lander.\nA final set of tests on the propulsion system showed leaks in one of the two PCVs \u2014 but not the one that ultimately leaked on orbit. That one tested fine; the one that leaked was repaired. While Bhaskaran acknowledged that the second PCV was identified \u201cas a risk in our risk register\u201d due to the leak with the first during testing, engineers ultimately deemed that the failure was low because the lander passed final acceptance testing.\nHe justified not replacing the second PCV, saying it was located much farther into the spacecraft and would have required \u201cextensive surgery\u201d on the lander, invalidated the final testing, and carried additional risk that comes with disassembly and reassembly.\nHorack echoed that the team\u2019s decision-making was sound throughout: \u201cI really found that, in looking at the team and looking at what happened \u2026 I can\u2019t see any decisions that were made in the flow leading up to the launch where I would have said, \u2018Hey, I think you should have done this differently.\u2019\u201d\nThese findings have already started to inform the development of the much larger Griffin lander, which is currently scheduled to launch to the moon before the end of 2025. In addition to redesigning the valve, engineers have introduced a regulator in the propulsion system to control the flow of helium to the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and backup latch valves as added redundancy in case the issue reoccurs with a PCV.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle Meet\u2019s automatic AI note-taking is here\ndescription4:\nGoogle Meet\u2019s newest AI-powered feature, \u201ctake notes for me,\u201d has started rolling out today to Google Workspace customers with the Gemini Enterprise, Gemini Education Premium, or AI Meetings & Messaging add-ons. It\u2019s similar to Meet\u2019s transcription tool, only instead of automatically transcribing what everyone says, it summarizes what everyone talked about. Google first announced this feature at its 2023 Cloud Next conference.\nUnfortunately, it only supports spoken English right now, but it seems like it could make missing an important meeting less stressful; it automatically takes notes in a Google Doc and will attach that file to the calendar event after the meeting is over, so you can reference them later on. It will also send that Google Doc to the meeting organizer and anyone else who turned the feature on.\nClick on the pencil icon in the top right corner to have Google Meet start taking notes. Image: Google\nRunning late to a meeting? Google says its new feature will also give you a summary of what you missed, so when you are able to join, you can quickly catch up \u2014 and no one should have to worry about repeating themselves. If you use Google Meet\u2019s recordings and transcripts tool at the same time, links to those files will also be provided in the same Google Doc with the meeting notes.\nThis feature also sounds like a good accessibility tool for anyone (like me) who has trouble processing spoken language and taking notes at the same time.
