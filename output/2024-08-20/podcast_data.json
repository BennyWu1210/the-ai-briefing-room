Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday August 21), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI announces content deal with Cond\u00e9 Nast\ndescription0:\nOpenAI on Tuesday announced a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast, in which the Microsoft -backed artificial intelligence company's products, such as ChatGPT and SearchGPT, will be able to display content from Vogue, The New Yorker, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, GQ, Architectural Digest, Vanity Fair, Wired, Bon App\u00e9tit and other outlets.\n\"With the introduction of our SearchGPT prototype, we're testing new search features that make finding information and reliable content sources faster and more intuitive,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \"We're combining our conversational models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.\"\nOpenAI added that the SearchGPT prototype offers direct links to news stories and that the company plans \"to integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in the future.\"\nIt is the latest in a recent trend of some media outlets joining forces with AI startups such as OpenAI to enter into content deals.\nIn July, Perplexity AI debuted a revenue-sharing model for publishers following more than a month of plagiarism accusations. Media outlets and content platforms including Fortune, Time, Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, Der Spiegel and WordPress.com were the first to join the company's \"Publishers Program.\"\nOpenAI and Time magazine announced a \"multi-year content deal\" in June that will allow OpenAI to access current and archived articles from more than 100 years of Time's history. OpenAI will be able to display Time's content within its ChatGPT chatbot in response to user questions, according to a press release, and use Time's content \"to enhance its products,\" or, likely, to train its AI models.\nOpenAI announced a similar partnership in May with News Corp., allowing OpenAI to access current and archived articles from The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Barron's, the New York Post and other publications. Reddit also announced in May that it will partner with OpenAI, allowing the company to train its AI models on Reddit content.\nOther news publications and media outlets are aggressively trying to protect their businesses as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent.\nThe Center for Investigative Reporting, the country's oldest nonprofit newsroom, sued OpenAI and lead backer Microsoft in federal court in June for alleged copyright infringement, following similar suits from publications including The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News.\nIn December, The New York Times filed a suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging intellectual property violations related to its journalistic content appearing in ChatGPT training data. The Times said it seeks to hold Microsoft and OpenAI accountable for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of the Times's uniquely valuable works,\" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. OpenAI disagreed with the Times' characterization of events.\nThe Chicago Tribune, along with seven other newspapers, followed with a suit in April.\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo says it doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since May\ndescription1:\nWaymo is now providing more than 100,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in the U.S., according to a LinkedIn announcement by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana. That's double the 50,000 weekly paid trips the company reported in May.\nA spokesperson for the Alphabet -owned driverless vehicle venture told CNBC on Tuesday that San Francisco now \"serves the most trips\" among the cities where Waymo operates its commercial service: San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin and Los Angeles.\nLast month, Alphabet announced that it was investing an additional $5 billion into Waymo, which started as a self-driving project at the company in 2009.\nOn Monday, Waymo revealed details about its new, \"generation 6\" self-driving system, which should enable the company to offer driverless services in a wider array of weather conditions and without requiring as many costly cameras and sensors in its vehicles.\nWaymo, which boasts around 700 vehicles in its fleet today, operates the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., Waymo One.\nWaymo previously partnered with the ride-hailing giant Uber in Phoenix to bring its service to the app's existing users there. In a statement Tuesday, Waymo said that in June it added 90 square miles to its service in Phoenix, making it the largest autonomous ride-hailing \"territory\" in the states.\nThis month, Waymo also expanded its San Francisco robotaxi service into three new California areas \u2014 Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma \u2014 and is now testing its driverless vehicles on freeways around the San Francisco metro area.\nWhile CNBC could not independently confirm the company's safety claims, Waymo also said that \"over 14.8 million rider-only miles driven, the Waymo Driver was 3.5x better in avoiding crashes that caused injuries and 3x better in avoiding police-reported crashes than human drivers.\"\nAlthough commercial robotaxi services from Didi and Pony.ai are up and running in China, Waymo currently faces limited domestic competition. GM -owned Cruise experienced setbacks that took its driverless vehicles off the road temporarily, and companies including Uber and Ford have shuttered their efforts to develop robotaxis.\nElon Musk's electric vehicle maker, Tesla , has been promising it would turn customers' existing vehicles into driverless cars with a software update for years. However, the company has not yet produced a car capable of serving as a robotaxi. Tesla plans to unveil its CyberCab, or dedicated robotaxi, at a hotly anticipated event Oct. 10.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon-backed Anthropic hit with class-action lawsuit over copyright infringement\ndescription2:\nAnthropic, the Amazon -backed artificial intelligence startup, on Monday was hit with a class-action lawsuit in California federal court over alleged copyright infringement. Three authors said in the filing that Anthropic \"built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books,\" including their own.\nAnthropic, which was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, has backers including Google and Salesforce.\nAuthors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson alleged in the lawsuit that \"an essential component of Anthropic's business model \u2014 and its flagship 'Claude' family of large language models (or 'LLMs')\u2014 is the largescale theft of copyrighted works,\" later alleging that \"Anthropic downloaded known pirated versions of Plaintiffs' works, made copies of them, and fed these pirated copies into its models.\"\nThe lawsuit follows Anthropic's June debut of its most powerful AI model yet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude is one of the chatbots that, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google 's Gemini, has exploded in popularity in the past year.\n\"Copyright law prohibits what Anthropic has done here: downloading and copying hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books taken from pirated and illegal websites,\" the lawsuit states.\nAnthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis week's case also follows another lawsuit brought against Anthropic last October, in which Universal Music sued the startup over \"systematic and widespread infringement of their copyrighted song lyrics,\" per a filing in a Tennessee federal court. Other music publishers, such as Concord and ABKCO, were also named as plaintiffs.\nOne example from Universal Music's lawsuit: When a user asked Anthropic's AI chatbot Claude about the lyrics to the song \"Roar\" by Katy Perry, it generated an \"almost identical copy of those lyrics,\" violating the rights of Concord, the copyright owner, per the filing. The lawsuit also named Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive\" as an example of Anthropic's alleged copyright infringement, as Universal owns the rights to its lyrics.\n\"In the process of building and operating AI models, Anthropic unlawfully copies and disseminates vast amounts of copyrighted works,\" the lawsuit stated, later adding, \"Just like the developers of other technologies that have come before, from the printing press to the copy machine to the web-crawler, AI companies must follow the law.\"\nWith the news industry broadly struggling to maintain sufficient advertising and subscription revenue to pay for its costly newsgathering operations, many news publications and media outlets are aggressively trying to protect their businesses as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent.\nThe Center for Investigative Reporting, the country's oldest nonprofit newsroom, sued OpenAI and lead backer Microsoft in federal court in June for alleged copyright infringement, following similar suits from publications including The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune and The New York Daily News.\nIn December, The New York Times filed a suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging intellectual property violations related to its journalistic content appearing in ChatGPT training data. The Times said it seeks to hold Microsoft and OpenAI accountable for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of the Times's uniquely valuable works,\" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. OpenAI disagreed with the Times' characterization of events.\nThe Chicago Tribune, along with seven other newspapers, followed with a suit in April.\nOutside of news, a group of prominent U.S. authors, including Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult, sued OpenAI last year, alleging copyright infringement in using their work to train ChatGPT.\nBut not all news organizations are gearing up for a fight, and some are instead joining forces with AI startups.\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI announced a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast, in which ChatGPT and SearchGPT will display content from Vogue, The New Yorker, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, GQ, Architectural Digest, Vanity Fair, Wired, Bon App\u00e9tit and other outlets.\nIn July, Perplexity AI debuted a revenue-sharing model for publishers following more than a month of plagiarism accusations.

Reddit also announced in May that it will partner with OpenAI, allowing the company to train its AI models on Reddit content.\n\ntitle3:\nThe banks that loaned Musk $13B to buy Twitter might be having regrets\ndescription3:\nX, formerly known as Twitter, looks like a pretty bad investment right about now.\nAs readers might recall, Elon Musk borrowed $13 billion from Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and five other major banks to help finance its $44 billion acquisition. According to the WSJ, the deal has since become the worst merger-finance deal for banks since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nWhy? When banks lend money for takeovers, they usually sell that debt on to others, earning fees on the transaction. That hasn\u2019t been possible with X because of its weak financials, so the loans have weighed the banks down, becoming, in industry parlance, \u201chung deals.\u201d\nThe WSJ notes that the banks agreed to underwrite these loans \u201clargely because the allure of banking the world\u2019s richest person was too attractive to pass up.\u201d Now, it looks like a costly mistake unless they can extract interest payments from X, plus a repayment of principal once the loans mature.\n\ntitle4:\nCisco employees face a month of silence ahead of second layoff in 2024\ndescription4:\nAfter tech giant Cisco announced plans for its second round of layoffs this year, employees tell TechCrunch that they will not know if they are affected for close to a month.\nEarlier this month, Reuters reported that Cisco was planning a second round of layoffs this year, after letting go of around 4,000 workers in February. Cisco confirmed last week in a SEC filing that it is cutting 7% of its workforce.\nWhile employees have now been informed that there will be a new round of job cuts, the company has refused to tell affected workers until September 16, according to multiple Cisco employees.\nContact Us Do you have more information about the Cisco layoffs?

Revenue was down about 10% to about $13.6 billion during its fourth quarter.\nChuck Robbins, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Cisco delivered a \u201cstrong close to fiscal 2024.\u201d Robbins made $31.8 million in total executive compensation during 2023, the company\u2019s filings show.\"\n\nResponse:",
