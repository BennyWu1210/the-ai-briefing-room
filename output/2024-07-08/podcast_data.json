Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday July 9), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nValuations of startups have quietly rebounded to all-time highs. Some investors say the slump is over.\ndescription0:\nGenerative AI businesses aside, the last couple of years have been relatively difficult for venture-backed companies. Very few startups were able to raise funding at prices that exceeded their previous valuations.\nNow, approximately two years after the venture slump began in early 2022, some investors, like IVP general partner Tom Loverro, are saying that the worst of the downturn is behind us and the startups that survived should shift from cash preservation mode to spending money on growth.\nThese are not entirely empty words. According to PitchBook data, valuations for all but seed-stage companies dropped in 2023 compared to the year prior. But during the first six months of 2024, prices investors were willing to pay for new deals of U.S.-based companies not only recovered, but also reached an all-time high for median early- and late-stage deals, according to the latest report from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association.\n\u201cThe valuations for companies that are getting term sheets have been high,\u201d said Stephanie Choo, a partner at fintech-focused Portage Ventures.\nWhile fintech has been out of favor with investors since the start of the downturn, Choo said that the number of companies that can raise capital at higher valuations has increased since the beginning of the year. She pointed to U.K. challenger bank Monzo, which grabbed a valuation of over $5 billion in March, a nearly 15% increase from the $4.5 billion investors assigned it in early 2022.\nOver the last two years, many startups have cut spending, which helped them grow and, in some cases, surpass their previous valuations, Choo said.\nSamir Kaji, founder of Allocate, a startup that allows family offices and wealth advisers to invest in VC funds, is also optimistic that valuations and the fundraising environment have improved for startups this year. \u201cThings are much more sanguine than I\u2019ve seen since the beginning of 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cThe capital markets are coming back slowly, and if you can achieve real growth and fundamentals, there is going to be capital for [your startup].\u201d\nBut those \u201call-time\u201d high valuations are somewhat misleading, said Kyle Stanford, lead U.S. venture capital analyst at PitchBook. That\u2019s because deal volume is still sluggish. There were fewer companies that raised a new round with a known valuation in the first half of 2024 than is typical for a six-month period.\nPitchBook\u2019s valuation dataset consists primarily of strong companies that were able to grow into their previous valuations, but startups that couldn\u2019t secure funding at a higher valuation might have been left out of this data. Many took unpriced rounds through convertible notes, insider rounds or delayed raising capital altogether, Stanford explained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good market right now, if you are a strong company, but if you\u2019re struggling to hit growth targets you had set out before the pandemic, it\u2019s a really hard market,\u201d he said.\nKaji echoed this sentiment, but his take was a little more upbeat. He said that while startups are still divided into \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots,\u201d the group of companies that can potentially raise at higher valuations has grown larger in 2024.\nStartup valuations are improving for stronger companies for several reasons.\nThere\u2019s renewed optimism that inflation is under control, and the U.S. Fed may cut interest rates soon. Additionally, the stock market has seen a significant run-up this year, influencing private investors\u2019 outlook. Lastly, a meaningful portion of companies that raised funding in 2024 include AI companies, and AI startups receive significantly higher valuations than other sectors, Stanford said.\n\ntitle1:\nWhy Amazon, Tesla and Microsoft are investing in AI-powered robots\ndescription1:\nAI-powered robots are popping up across Silicon Valley. If some industry experts are right, they could help solve a global labor shortage.\nCompanies like Tesla, Amazon , Microsoft and Nvidia have plowed billions of dollars into what are known as \"humanoid\" robots. These machines typically stand on two legs, and are designed to perform tasks meant for people.\nFor now, they're being deployed in warehouses. But proponents say the possibilities extend well beyond fulfillment centers. These bots could eventually work alongside people, in homes and offices.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has been among the leading evangelists. The electric vehicle maker is betting on its Optimus robot, which Musk argues are \"going to transform the world to a degree even greater than the cars.\"\nDuring the company's first-quarter earnings call, Musk said Optimus could propel it to a $25 trillion market cap and that it will amount to \"a majority of Tesla's long-term value.\" Amazon has backed Agility Robotics, and is already deploying its Digit robots in fulfillment centers.\nThe market for humanoids is set to balloon to $38 billion in the next 20 years, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs. The firm predicts these robots will be the next \"must-have\" device, not unlike smartphones or EVs. Goldman also say humanoids may be \"vital for manufacturing and dangerous work, but they would also help with elderly care and fill in for labor shortages in factories.\"\n\ntitle2:\nCorning stock up 12% as AI boom drives stronger-than-expected demand\ndescription2:\nCorning shares closed up 12% Monday after the company raised its second-quarter guidance, marking the stock's best trading day since March 2020.\nThe company, known for developing the Gorilla Glass used for Apple iPhones and other phones, credits the outperformance to demand for its optical connectivity products that power networks that run generative artificial intelligence.\n\"We've invented new fibers, new cables, new connectors and new custom integrated optical solutions to dramatically reduce installation costs, overall time and space and carbon footprint,\" Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nCorning expects second-quarter sales of $3.6 billion, up from previous guidance of $3.4 billion. It also expects earnings per share to be \"at the high end or slightly above\" management's guided range of 42 cents to 46 cents per share.\nWeeks said in a release that second-quarter earnings are also expected to mark a return to year-over-year growth.\n\"These results reinforce our confidence in 'Springboard' \u2014 Corning's plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales in the next three years as cyclical factors and secular trends combine,\" Weeks added.\nThe company expects first-quarter sales, which declined 6% year over year, to be the lowest of the year. It anticipates higher sales throughout 2024 due to improving market conditions.\nCorning said it will report second-quarter 2024 results on July 30, 2024.\n\ntitle3:\nLucid Motors sets new record for EV deliveries as it seeks 'escape velocity'\ndescription3:\nLucid Motors delivered 2,394 EVs in the second quarter of 2024, a new record for the company and a positive sign amid its struggle to establish a foothold in the still-growing market for electric vehicles.\nThat number easily clears Lucid\u2019s prior record, which it set in the first quarter of the year when it shipped 1,967 of its luxury sedans. The Saudi-backed, California-based company has been looking to expand the number of buyers for its Lucid Air sedan by slashing prices and offering more affordable trims.\nThe starting price of Lucid\u2019s different versions of the Air have hovered close to \u2014 or exceeded \u2014 $100,000 since the company started shipping the sedan in 2021. But recent cuts have moved those prices down significantly, with the base model now starting at $69,900.\n\u201cFor the first time, I feel we\u2019re on the cusp of escape velocity. We have sales momentum, a compounding efficiency advantage, [and] unprecedented interest from consumers and corporate partners,\u201d CEO Peter Rawlinson said in May when discussing Lucid\u2019s first-quarter financial results.\nThese efforts have come as Lucid is looking to start building its Gravity SUV by the end of this year, a model the company says it expects will catch even more buyers in the U.S. market. The company announced the second-quarter delivery figures in a Monday morning press release, adding that it also built 2,110 in the same period.\nLucid\u2019s sales growth comes on the heels of quarterly delivery reports from peers like Rivian and Tesla, which were released last week. Rivian\u2019s sales remained roughly flat both compared to the first quarter and year-over-year. Tesla\u2019s sales moved up from the first quarter, but were down compared to the same period in 2023.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon revives its Echo Spot with an upgraded look and improved audio\ndescription4:\nAmazon has released an all-new version of its Echo Spot ahead of Prime Day, the company announced on Monday. The 2024 version of the Alexa-enabled smart alarm clock costs $79.99, but is currently on sale for $44.99 for Prime members.\nThe company says the latest iteration of the product comes with better visuals and improved audio quality. The device is available in Black, Glacier White and Ocean Blue.\nThe Echo Spot is designed to sit on your nightstand and features a display that lets you set and view alarms, and see the time, weather and song titles. It also features a 1.73\u201d front-firing directional speaker that delivers \u201cclear vocals and deep bass.\u201d\nUnlike the 2017 Echo Spot, the newest version doesn\u2019t have an integrated camera for video calling. This change could be a welcome one, especially for people who didn\u2019t want to have a device with a camera in their bedroom. And while the previous Echo Spot featured a full, circular screen, the latest version splits the front of the device with a speaker.\nImage Credits: Amazon\nThe device is Alexa-enabled, so you can use your voice to set alarms. You also can ask Alexa to play a certain song, call someone, make household announcements and more.\nLike its predecessor, the new Echo Spot can be customized. You can mix and match colors with a variety of clock faces or choose from six different color arrangements: magenta, violet, orange, lime, teal or blue.\nUnlike Amazon\u2019s Echo Show products, the Echo Spot\u2019s display is designed to show animations as opposed to video. For instance, when you ask Alexa about the weather, the Echo Spot displays illustrations on the screen to reflect the weather alongside the temperature.\nYou also can connect Echo Spot to compatible smart home products and set up Alexa Routines to automate daily tasks.\"\n\nResponse:",
