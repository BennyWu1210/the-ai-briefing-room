Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The loss was nearly $300 million worse than the second quarter last year.\nAs a result, Rivian\u2019s balance of cash and cash equivalents was $5.76 billion at the end of the quarter. That includes the first $1 billion from VW.\nThis all comes as Rivian has begun shipping revamped versions of the R1 that are simpler and cheaper to make. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has said these vehicles, shipped at scale, should help the company reach positive gross profit by the end of 2024.\nBut since Rivian is expecting to make and sell roughly the same number of EVs this year as it did in 2023, all eyes are on its second model \u2014 the R2 SUV, due out in 2026 \u2014 to help establish it as a sustainable company.\nUntil then, Rivian will be helped by the additional $4 billion that VW will pour into the young automaker \u2014 as long as the two companies finalize the agreement. That is supposed to happen sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Once complete, the deal will see Rivian and VW create a joint venture that will leverage Rivian\u2019s advanced electrical architecture and software. That technology will flow into Rivian\u2019s R2 and the many VW Group\u2019s EVs, and possibly ones built by other automakers.\nScaringe was careful not to share much new information about the VW tie-up during a conference call Tuesday. But chief software officer Wassym Bensaid said Rivian has a drivable demonstrator vehicle equipped with the company\u2019s electronic components and its software stack.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually extremely excited with the progress that we\u2019re making in the electrical architecture integration analysis. Our engineers have been working very closely with the Volkswagen Group,\u201d Bensaid said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward really, really well in understanding how our technology will scale up and down the entire Volkswagen Group portfolio.\u201d\nRivian had previously said in the run-up to the announcement that it had completed \u201csignificant work\u201d to \u201cvalidate that Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software are compatible with Volkswagen Group\u2019s vehicles.\u201d Harry Porter, a spokesperson for Rivian, declined to offer any further information about the demonstrator vehicle.\nUntil the VW deal is done, Rivian will turn to other methods to pad out its business. For instance, the company said it sold $17 million worth of regulatory credits to other companies in the second quarter. Scaringe said on the call that major automakers scaling back EV ambitions has created a \u201cvoid of products\u201d that is increasing the opportunity for Rivian to sell these credits \u2014 so much so, he said, that Rivian could wind up selling more than it had anticpated.\nThe company is also building out an EV charging network to support its vehicles that could pull in some extra revenue, especially as Rivian allows other EVs to access it starting later this year.\n\ntitle1:\nAirbnb shares fall 14% on earnings miss, fear of slowing U.S. demand\ndescription1:\nAirbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky speaks at The Fast Company Innovation Festival on September 21, 2022, in New York.\nAirbnb shares dropped 14% in after-hours trading after the company reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst expectations and warned that it's seeing signs of slowing demand from U.S. customers.\nHere's how the company did compared to LSEG estimates for the quarter ended June 30:\nEarnings per share: 86 cents vs. 92 cents expected\n86 cents vs. 92 cents expected Revenue: $2.75 billion vs. $2.74 billion expected\nRevenue increased 11% year over year. Airbnb reported a net income of $555 million, or 86 cents per share, down 15% from $650 million, or 98 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter.\nThe vacation rental company guided to third-quarter revenue of $3.67 billion to $3.73 billion, but also warned that it expected moderation in year-over-year growth in its key \"Nights and Experiences\" category, relative to the current quarter. It also cautioned that it was \"seeing shorter booking lead times globally and some signs of slowing demand from U.S. guests.\"\nAirbnb said users booked 125.1 million Nights and Experiences, its highest second-quarter result. \"We saw continued growth across all regions compared to Q2 2023, with Asia Pacific and Latin America again leading the way,\" it said in its letter to shareholders.\nThe company also said it had removed more than 200,000 low-quality listings since it launched its \"quality system\" more than a year ago.\nInvestors are carefully watching for signs to see if the consumer is under pressure, as the Federal Reserve has held off on rate cuts until next month at the earliest. There have been some troubling signs in other companies' results. McDonalds , for example, warned that consumers were feeling \"the pinch\" from the economy in its most recent earnings report, which saw same-store sales fall 1%.\n\ntitle2:\nElon Musk's X sues advertisers over alleged 'massive advertiser boycott' after Twitter takeover\ndescription2:\nElon Musk's social media platform X has sued a group of advertisers, alleging that a \"massive advertiser boycott\" deprived the company of billions of dollars in revenue and violated antitrust laws.\nThe company formerly known as Twitter filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a federal court in Texas against the World Federation of Advertisers and member companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health and Orsted.\nIt accused the advertising group's initiative, called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, of helping to coordinate a pause in advertising after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and overhauled its staff and policies.\nMusk posted about the lawsuit on X on Tuesday, saying \"now it is war\" after two years of being nice and \"getting nothing but empty words.\"\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a video announcement that the lawsuit stemmed in part from evidence uncovered by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee which she said showed a \"group of companies organized a systematic illegal boycott\" against X.\nThe Republican-led committee had a hearing last month looking at whether current laws are \"sufficient to deter anticompetitive collusion in online advertising.\"\nThe lawsuit's allegations center on the early days of Musk's Twitter takeover and not a more recent dispute with advertisers that came a year later.\nIn November 2023, about a year after Musk bought the company, a number of advertisers began fleeing X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.\nMusk later said those fleeing advertisers were engaging in \"blackmail\" and, using a profanity, essentially told them to go away.\nThe Belgium-based World Federation of Advertisers and representatives for CVS, Orsted, Mars and Unilever didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\n\ntitle3:\nWaymo expands robotaxi coverage in Los Angeles and San Francisco\ndescription3:\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving car company, is adding another 10 square miles to its robotaxi service area to include cities surrounding San Francisco.\nThe move, which adds Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma, pushes its total commercial service territory to about 55 square miles. Waymo said Tuesday it is also adding 16 square miles of new robotaxi service area in Los Angeles, including Marina del Rey, Mar Vista, Playa Vista, and more of Hollywood, Chinatown and Westwood.\nWaymo has been pushing to add more territory and reach more customers in a bid to scale its commercial operations and eventually become profitable \u2014 although that goal is still out of reach. The ever-expanding service territories have helped Waymo reach several other milestones. The company said it has provided more than two million paid trips to riders across all Waymo One markets, which includes Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. The company said its fleet of commercial vehicles serves more than 50,000 paid trips each week across those same markets.\nWhile these operations generate revenue, Waymo\u2019s operations are still supported by its backers. Its parent company, Alphabet, has been the primary source of capital, recently announcing it will invest another $5 billion into Waymo.\nExpanded service area in San Francisco. Image Credits: Waymo\nThis latest expansion comes several months after receiving approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Peninsula and on San Francisco freeways. Waymo has been testing its self-driving vehicles in the greater SF Peninsula.\nWaymo has operated a commercial service 24 hours a day, seven days a week throughout the city of San Francisco since receiving approval from the commission in August 2023. The CPUC approved in March 2024 Waymo\u2019s request to expand commercial operations into new territory. Waymo doesn\u2019t provide detailed information on its global fleet. However, a spokesperson did tell TechCrunch that today there are about 300 vehicles in San Francisco, 50 in Los Angeles and 200 in Phoenix. The company also has a limited fleet that is testing in Austin. Other Waymo vehicles are still used for testing in Mountain View, California, and periodically in other areas.\nWaymo said demand has increased in Los Angeles and more than 150,000 people have signed up for the waitlist. Waymo removed the waitlist for San Francisco riders in June.\n\ntitle4:\nReddit to test AI-powered search result pages\ndescription4:\nReddit users will soon see AI-generated summaries at the top of search results.\nReddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told investors during its earnings call on Tuesday that the company plans to test AI-powered search result pages to \u201csummarize and recommend content.\u201d He noted this will help users \u201cdive deeper\u201d into content and discover new Reddit communities.\nReddit will use a combination of first-party and third-party technology to power the feature, Huffman explained. The company will begin the experiment later this year.\nThose who have been following the company\u2019s latest initiatives likely expected something like an AI-powered search feature to be on Reddit\u2019s radar. In May, Reddit announced its partnership with OpenAI, enabling the company to leverage OpenAI\u2019s large language models and build AI-powered features for Redditors and mods. The deal also gives OpenAI permission to use the social network\u2019s data. Reddit signed a similar agreement with Google earlier this year.\nAI was a common topic in today\u2019s call. Huffman also touted the success of Reddit\u2019s AI-powered language translation feature, reporting that France is one of its \u201cfastest growing countries,\u201d he claimed. The company is also beginning to expand the translation feature to German, Spanish and Portuguese.\nToday marked the second time Reddit reported its quarterly earnings since becoming a public company. For the second quarter, the company reported 342.3 million weekly active users, a 57% jump from the year prior. Revenue increased to $281.2 million, higher than Wall Street estimates of $253.8 million.\nUpdated 8/6/24 at 8:10 pm ET to correct the speaker of the quote as being Reddit\u2019s CEO Steve Huffman, not Drew Vollero (CFO).\"\n\nResponse:",
