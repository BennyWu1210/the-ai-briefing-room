Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday June 25), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI buys a remote collaboration platform\ndescription0:\nOpenAI is on an M&A tear.\nDays after acquiring database tech firm Rockset, OpenAI has purchased Multi (previously Remotion), a startup developing an enterprise-focused, video-first collaboration platform. A source familiar with the matter says that the deal is technically an acqui-hire and that most of Multi\u2019s team \u2014 around five people \u2014 will join OpenAI following the deal\u2019s close.\nAlexander Embiricos, Multi\u2019s CEO and one of its co-founders, says that Multi will shut down after July 24.\n\u201cWe\u2019re beyond excited to share that Multi is joining OpenAI,\u201d he wrote in a post on Multi\u2019s blog. \u201cThank you to everybody who used Multi. It was a privilege building with you, and we learned a ton from you.\u201d\nWith Multi, Embiricos (an ex-Dropbox product manager) and Multi\u2019s second co-founder, Charley Ho (an ex-Google software engineer), set out to build a Zoom-based platform designed for remote teams to work together through video chats. Multi offered features like the ability to collaborate across screen shares from up to 10 people at the same time, customizable shortcuts and automatic deep links for code, designs and documents.\nExcited to share that Multi has been acquired by OpenAI!\nTo everyone who used Multi, submitted feedback and offered feature suggestions, Thank You. https://t.co/KU0AroW1tQ \u2014 Charley Ho (@potatoarecool) June 24, 2024\nAccording to Crunchbase data, Multi raised $13 million in cash from VCs including Greylock and First Round Capital prior to Monday\u2019s exit.\nAs with the Rockset buy, the Multi deal seems to fit into OpenAI\u2019s broader recent strategy of investing heavily in enterprise solutions. OpenAI recently revealed that the corporate tier of its viral AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT, had close to 600,000 users, including 93% of all Fortune 500 firms.\nIn May, OpenAI signed an agreement with PwC to resell OpenAI\u2019s tools to other businesses. The month before, the company launched a business-oriented custom AI model tuning and consulting program.\nThe enterprise buys appear to be paying dividends, with OpenAI\u2019s revenue set to eclipse $3.4 billion this year, per The Information.\nAlong the same vein as OpenAI\u2019s other corporate-aimed product efforts, could we one day see a spruced-up ChatGPT with videoconferencing and remote collaboration capabilities? Maybe. I wouldn\u2019t put it past OpenAI \u2014 particularly as the lag time between the org\u2019s flagship models lengthens.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia slides 13% in three days after becoming most valuable company\ndescription1:\nSince briefly becoming the world's most valuable company last week, Nvidia has dropped for three consecutive trading days and is now down 13% from its peak.\nMonday's slide was the chipmaker's second steepest drop of the year, as the stock fell 6.7% to $118.11. Nvidia's decline brought with it a slide in chipmakers and other tech companies that have been tied to the artificial intelligence boom.\nSuper Micro Computer , which sells servers packed with Nvidia's AI chips, fell 8.7 percent, and Dell , which competes in that market, was off 5.2%.\nChip designer Arm dropped 5.8%, while semiconductor giants Qualcomm and Broadcom dropped 5.5% and 3.7%, respectively.\nMany of these companies have been some of the biggest gainers in the last couple of years as investors bet heavily that they'll be the prime beneficiaries of a wave of AI spending.\nNvidia's value has nearly tripled in the past year even after the three-day slump. Last week, it topped Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable U.S. company with a market capitalization over $3 trillion before giving up some of those gains. Nvidia was the fourth-biggest loser in the S&P 500 on Monday. Super Micro is still up almost 200% in 2024.\nInvestors may be taking an opportunity to lock in gains after a few hot months.\n\"I don't think the party is over, but it's had a heck of a run and there are so many other places in technology that offer better attractive risk/reward,\" Hightower's Stephanie Link told CNBC on Friday, calling Nvidia shares \"overloved.\"\nNvidia has said that demand for its prized AI graphics processing units (GPUs) remains high, as companies including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and Meta buy billions of dollars worth of the chips to power their data centers and cloud services.\nLater this year, Nvidia will start shipping its next-generation AI chips, called Blackwell, that some analysts expect could kick off another up cycle of significant growth for the chipmaker and its partners.\nNvidia's performance \"is going to continue for the next 18-24 months,\" Constellation Research founder Ray Wang said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday. \"I think it's a good time to buy the dip.\"\n\ntitle2:\nApple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act\ndescription2:\nA few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.\n\ntitle4:\nTarget and Shopify team up to expand Target\u2019s third-party marketplace\ndescription4:\nShopify merchants can now sell their items to Target\u2019s millions of shoppers, thanks to a new partnership. The companies announced on Monday that sellers on the commerce platform can apply to join Target Plus, the retail giant\u2019s third-party marketplace where merchants can sell and manage orders.\nTarget is the first major retailer to collaborate with Shopify to introduce its merchants\u2019 products into physical stores. The initial group of Shopify sellers to be featured at Target include True Classic and Caden Lane, among others.\nTarget Plus launched in 2019 to allow consumers to discover new products from third-party retailers, such as Crocs, Maui Jim, Timberland and Ruggable. However, the retailer lags behind rivals like Amazon, eBay and Walmart. In the face of stiff competition, Target is making a strategic move by partnering with Shopify to boost its third-party marketplace, which currently hosts 1,200 sellers, a fraction of Amazon\u2019s nearly 2 million selling partners and Walmart\u2019s 135,000.\nThe partnership announcement follows Target\u2019s unsatisfactory quarterly results, which showed a 3.7% decline in comparable sales. This marks the fourth quarter in a row of decreasing comparable sales for the company. Additionally, Target\u2019s overall sales dropped by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2024.\"\n\nResponse:",
