Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The launch puts Apple Maps in direct competition with Google Maps, which has long been available on the web.\nMaps on the web is accessible in English and is compatible with Safari and Chrome on Mac and iPad, as well as Chrome and Edge on Windows PCs. Apple plans to bring support for additional languages, browsers and platforms in the future.\nApple Maps on the web works like it does on the mobile app. You can get driving and walking directions; order food from the Maps place card; browse curated guides and reviews; and more. Apple plans to bring additional functionality, like its 360-degree panoramic views \u201cLook Around\u201d feature, to the web version in the coming months.\nApple notes that developers can link out to Maps on the web, allowing their users to get driving directions, see detailed place information, and more.\nThe launch of the web version of Apple Maps comes 12 years after Apple launched the service on the iPhone. By expanding the availability of Apple Maps, the company is seeking to reach more users and take on Google Maps, which has largely been the go-to place for maps on the web.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla shares fall after second-quarter earnings miss\ndescription1:\nIn this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla. Antonio Masiello | Getty Images\nTesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue. The stock closed down 12% on Wednesday at $215.99. It's now down 13% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over that stretch. Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7% from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion. The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition, especially in China.\nTesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far, but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk's incendiary and political commentary. Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents, according to LSEG. And Tesla's adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. It's the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage. Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story, including when the company will introduce a new mass-market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new \"affordable\" car in the first half of next year. Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber-style ride-hailing service, with the cars driving autonomously.\nwatch now\n\ntitle2:\nMeta cracks down on \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019 and thousands of sextortion accounts\ndescription2:\nMeta shut down 63,000 Instagram accounts based in Nigeria that it says were engaged in financial sextortion scams and connected to what Meta calls a \u201cloosely organized\u201d group of cybercriminals known as the \u201cYahoo Boys.\u201d\nMeta has been getting serious about cracking down on sextortion scams and educating users about how to avoid them. Earlier this year, Meta said it would automatically send suspected sextortion account messages to users\u2019 hidden requests folder. If users were already talking to a potential scam or sextortion account, it would display a safety notice prompting them to report threats to share private images. Meta said it would also make it so that potential sextortion accounts wouldn\u2019t be able to view the \u201cMessage\u201d button on teens\u2019 profiles, even if they\u2019re already connected.\nMeta said that the new technical signals it\u2019s created helped track down the network of sextortion accounts. Of the 63,000 accounts Meta said it removed, 2,500 were part of a coordinated network linked to a group of 20 people. Meta said the network mostly targeted adult men in the US, and most of their attempts were unsuccessful. After identifying the network of 2,500 accounts, Meta said it was able to find more accounts in Nigeria engaged in similar scams, leading to the rest of the accounts it removed.\nMeta also removed thousands of Facebook accounts, groups, and pages based in Nigeria that gave scammers tips, fake photos to use on accounts, and scripts. Its system is now identifying and blocking any attempts by these groups to return to the site.\n\ntitle3:\nCrowdStrike offers a $10 apology gift card to say sorry for outage\ndescription3:\nCrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that crashed millions of computers with a botched update all over the world last week, is offering its partners a $10 Uber Eats gift card as an apology, according to several people who say they received the gift card, as well as a source who also received one.\nOn Tuesday, a source told TechCrunch that they received an email from CrowdStrike offering them the gift card because the company recognizes \u201cthe additional work that the July 19 incident has caused.\u201d\n\u201cAnd for that, we send our heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience,\u201d the email read, according to a screenshot shared by the source. The same email was also posted on X by someone else. \u201cTo express our gratitude, your next cup of coffee or late night snack is on us!\u201d\nA screenshot of the email sent to partners by CrowdStrike after the July 19 incident. Image Credits: TechCrunch / supplied\nThe email was sent from a CrowdStrike email address in the name of Daniel Bernard, the company\u2019s chief business officer, according to a screenshot of the email seen by TechCrunch. According to one post on X, in the United Kingdom the voucher was worth \u00a37.75, or roughly $10 at today\u2019s exchange rate.\nOn Wednesday, some of the people who posted about the gift card said that when they went to redeem the offer, they got an error message saying the voucher had been canceled. When TechCrunch checked the voucher, the Uber Eats page provided an error message that said the gift card \u201chas been canceled by the issuing party and is no longer valid.\u201d\nCrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci confirmed to TechCrunch that the company sent the gift cards.\n\u201cWe did send these to our teammates and partners who have been helping customers through this situation. Uber flagged it as fraud because of high usage rates,\u201d Benacci said in an email.\nOn Friday, CrowdStrike released a faulty update that rendered around 8.5 million Windows devices unusable, according to Microsoft. The update caused the affected computers to be stuck at the infamous \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d or BSOD, a bright blue error screen with a message that is shown when Windows crashes or cannot load because of a critical software failure.\nThe outage caused delays at airports in Amsterdam, Berlin, Dubai, and London, and across the United States. It also caused several hospitals to halt surgeries, and paralyzed countless businesses all over the world.\nContact Us Do you have more information about the CrowdStrike outage?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\nSince the outage began on Friday, CrowdStrike has regularly published updates on its efforts to figure out what caused the mass outage. In an update on Wednesday, the company said that because of a bug during the process to check that updates are ready to be released to customer devices, the faulty code \u201cpassed validation despite containing problematic content data.\u201d\nThe company also published apologies from its CEO George Kurtz, as well as its chief security officer Shawn Henry.\n\u201cAll of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,\u201d Kurtz said in a message published on the company\u2019s site. \u201cNothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike. As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we\u2019re taking to prevent anything like this from happening again.\u201d\nHenry wrote on Linkedin that \u201cwe failed you, and for that I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in my professional life for almost 40 years, and my North Star has always been to \u2018protect good people from bad things,\u2019\u201d Henry wrote. \u201cThe past two days have been the most challenging 48 hours for me over 12+ years. The confidence we built in drips over the years was lost in buckets within hours, and it was a gut punch.\u201d\nThis story was updated to include CrowdStrike\u2019s spokesperson statement.\n\ntitle4:\nColin Kaepernick lost control of his story. Now he wants to help creators own theirs\ndescription4:\nThousands of stories have been written about former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick. If anyone knows a thing or two about losing control of your own narrative, it\u2019s him. Now Kaepernick is launching an AI storytelling platform, Lumi, to help creators tell and own their stories.\nIf you said, \u201cHuh?\u201d when reading that, I wouldn\u2019t blame you. But the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback has more expertise here than you might realize. First off, Kaepernick says this is a solution for storytellers, and generative AI is merely a tool to get there. Kaepernick spent the last 10 years building a media company, Kaepernick Media, which exposed him to some of the media industry\u2019s deeply entrenched problems. He\u2019s also served on Medium\u2019s board since 2020. Lumi attempts to address issues like gatekeeping, production costs, and creatives losing ownership of their work. The solution is not revolutionary \u2014 an AI subscription, a distribution platform, and a revenue share plan \u2014 but the implementation might be.\nKaepernick made headlines during the 2016 NFL season, not for his passer rating, but for kneeling during the national anthem before football games. It was a protest to civil injustices against Black people, but many took his kneel to be disrespectful. At the time, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with what he\u2019s doing,\u201d while others, including former President Trump, said worse. After leaving the 49ers, Kaepernick struggled to land with another team despite leading San Francisco to a Super Bowl a few years earlier, leading to suspicions he\u2019d been blackballed by NFL owners.\n\u201cOn my own story \u2014 the impact and implications of other people creating their narratives around it and telling it from their perspective \u2014 why should that be the case?\u201d said Kaepernick in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThere are times in the past where I could have jumped out and told my story in different ways, but I try to be thoughtful of how I\u2019m building things and why I\u2019m doing them. If it\u2019s something that is just self-interested or self-fulfilling, that doesn\u2019t particularly interest me.\u201d\nBut with Lumi, Kaepernick sees an opportunity to empower storytellers more broadly. He may release a story on the platform himself, but that\u2019s not quite the point. Kaepernick\u2019s difficulties with the media industry have greatly impacted his own life, but now he\u2019s using the lesson to create a solution larger than himself.\nOn Wednesday, Lumi is emerging from stealth with $4 million in seed funding led by Seven Seven Six. The company is also allowing creators to sign up for its beta version today.\nCool! So what is it?\nKaepernick ultimately sees Lumi as an end-to-end media company \u2014 venturing into video eventually \u2014 offering creator tools, a distribution platform, publishing and merchandising services. For now, Lumi is starting small with creator tools for comic book illustrators, specifically the Japanese style, manga.\nThe first thing creators do when storytelling with Lumi is visit the website. There, you can create your story\u2019s main character by describing their backstory, physical characteristics, and other traits into a text-based AI model. That leads to an AI image generation of your character, which illustrators could use as inspiration or the actual character imagery to build a story around.\nThen Lumi\u2019s AI helps you plan out your story, asking questions about story structure, protagonists and antagonists, and themes and helping to generate a script. Then you\u2019ll get to the final product page, where all the imagery, dialogue and captions are formatted into a graphic novel. You can then publish your story and a digital version will go live on the front end of Lumi\u2019s website.\nBut Lumi also wants to make physical publishing and merchandising easier for creators. Kaepernick says his company will handle all the business logistics so creators can focus on storytelling, making Lumi a one-stop shop for all a creator\u2019s needs.\nCreators can choose from three monthly subscription tiers \u2014 $20, $40, and $75 \u2014 with more expensive tiers unlocking advanced features for creators. Kaepernick wants to share the revenue from these stories, physical copies, and merchandising with the creators.\nKaepernick\u2019s plan is centered around making Lumi an entertainment platform for manga fans. The idea is that there\u2019s some value baked into getting a story on Lumi\u2019s website, but that only works if people are coming to the destination.\nNo stranger to Silicon Valley\nLumi is the first startup Kaepernick has founded, but the former QB has been angel investing since 2017 and tells TechCrunch he has more than 50 investments to date. Kaepernick also sits on the board of digital publishing platform Medium and has since 2020. There, he\u2019s worked alongside influential Silicon Valley investors \u2014 including fellow board members such as a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz, Medium co-founder Evan Williams, and Heretic Ventures founder Mariam Naficy \u2014 who he says have shaped his business sense as a tech founder.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I woke up one day and was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna build a tech company,\u2019\u201d said Kaepernick. \u201cBut we were trying to solve this problem for creators that we\u2019re engaging with. It just so happens that the best way for us to do this is by building a tech company.\u201d\nKaepernick says he\u2019s not worried about wading into Silicon Valley more publicly as a founder at this politically charged moment, as some Silicon Valley leaders have publicly endorsed Trump. Kaepernick has been a civil rights activist for nearly a decade, leading the Know Your Rights Camp since 2016, whose mission is to \u201cadvance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities.\u201d With Lumi, Kaepernick says he\u2019s just focused on product.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any concerns entering the space during this time,\u201d said Kaepernick. \u201cMy thinking is, if we are serving our end user and creator in the best way possible, then we will have a successful company and everything else will take care of itself.\u201d\nLumi aims to uplift voices that aren\u2019t given a sufficient platform today. Kaepernick\u2019s business will use a few different foundational AI models, but he\u2019s keen to address the biases that have plagued LLMs for years.\n\u201cAI models as they exist today, they\u2019re going to have the biases of the past built into them. We\u2019ve seen that, we know that,\u201d says Kaepernick. \u201cWhen we think about narratives and how people are represented, AI is going to accelerate things exponentially.
