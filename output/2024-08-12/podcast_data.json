Chesnot | Getty Images\nLONDON \u2014 E-commerce giant Amazon's multibillion-dollar investment in the U.S. artificial intelligence firm Anthropic is formally being investigated by a U.K. competition regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority said Thursday that it has begun a \"Phase 1\" investigation into Amazon's investment and partnership with Anthropic to assess whether the deal has resulted in a relevant merger situation that may harm competition in the U.K. Following initial scrutiny into the Amazon-Anthropic partnership, the CMA now has \"sufficient information\" in relation to the tie-up to begin a formal probe, the regulator said in a notice on its website. The CMA now has up to 40 working days to decide whether the transaction could harm competition and should therefore be scrutinized further in an in-depth \"Phase 2\" investigation. Amazon completed in March a $4 billion investment in Anthropic. The deal consisted of an initial $1.25 billion equity stake in September, followed by a further $2.75 billion transaction finalized earlier this year.\nAs part of the deal Amazon will make Anthropic's powerful large language models available on its Bedrock platform for building generative AI applications. Anthropic's models will also be trained and deployed on Amazon's own custom AI chips, which were built by its Amazon Web Services cloud computing division. In a statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is \"disappointed\" the CMA proceeded with an initial Phase 1 merger probe, adding that its collaboration with Anthropic \"does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for review.\" \"By investing in Anthropic, Amazon, along with other companies, is helping Anthropic expand choice and competition in this important technology. Amazon holds no board seat nor decision-making power at Anthropic, and Anthropic is free to work with any other provider (and indeed has multiple partners),\" the spokesperson said via email. Amazon's spokesperson added that the company will continue to make Anthropic's models available to customers via Bedrock. An Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC: \"We are an independent company. Our strategic partnerships and investor relationships do not diminish our corporate governance independence or our freedom to partner with others.\" \"Amazon does not have a seat on Anthropic's board, nor does it have any board observer rights,\" the Anthropic spokesperson added. \"We welcome the opportunity to cooperate with the CMA and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of Amazon's investment and our commercial collaboration.\"\nwatch now\nThe Amazon-Anthropic pact is not the only deal facing scrutiny from regulators in the U.K. The CMA is separately scrutinizing U.S. software giant Microsoft 's multibillion-dollar partnership and investment in AI giant OpenAI. However, the watchdog is yet to reveal whether it will begin a Phase 1 investigation into the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. Stateside, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January sent orders to tech giants Microsoft , Amazon and Google , along with AI firms OpenAI and Anthropic, requiring them to share information about their respective recent investments and partnerships.\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday.

Apu Gomes | Getty Images\nThe European Commission on Monday warned X Corp. owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino that the company may face penalties and restrictions in Europe if it doesn't address the spread of illegal content, including incitements to violence and hate speech, on its social media platform. \"I am writing to you in the context of recent events in the United Kingdom and in relation to the planned broadcast on your platform X of a live conversation between a US presidential candidate and yourself, which will also be accessible to users in the EU,\" Thierry Breton, European commissioner for the internal market, wrote in a letter that was posted Monday on X. \"We are monitoring the potential risks in the EU associated with the dissemination of content that may incite violence, hate and racism in conjunction with major political - or societal - events around the world, including debates and interviews in the context of elections,\" wrote Breton. \"I therefore urge you to promptly ensure the effectiveness of your systems and to report measures taken to my team,\" he added.\nThierry Breton, France's European Union commissioner for internal market and consumer protection, industry, research and energy. JOHN THYS\nFollowing receipt of the letter, Yaccarino called it \"an unprecedented attempt to stretch a law intended to apply in Europe to political activities in the US.\" \"It also patronizes European citizens, suggesting they are incapable of listening to a conversation and drawing their own conclusions,\" Yaccarino wrote on X. Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla , is set to host Donald Trump on Monday evening on Spaces, the streaming platform of X. Billed as an unscripted conversation by Musk, the Spaces session will be one of the few campaign events Trump does this week. The Republican former president is still trying to find his footing in a newly competitive race against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The commissioner reminded Musk of due diligence obligations set out in the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 legislation requiring social networks and streaming media platforms to prevent the spread of hate speech and other harmful content on their platforms \u2014 amid an investigation of X into potential breaches of the law. Breton warned Musk that the EU was prepared to \"make full use of our toolbox\" to protect EU citizens from \"serious harm.\" Given X Corp.'s reported 300 million users worldwide (of which one-third are based in the EU), X is \"designated as a Very Large Online Platform\" with a legal obligation to follow European laws and specifically the Digital Services Act, wrote Breton. Riots that have taken place in the U.K. in recent weeks were sparked by disinformation that spread on X and other social media platforms, falsely identifying the perpetrator of attacks on children attending a dance class in an English town as an asylum-seeker.\nRiot police hold back protesters near a burning police vehicle after disorder broke out on July 30, 2024 in Southport, England. Rumours about the identity of the 17-year-old suspect after deadly stabbing attack in Southport sparked a violent protest with unrest spreading across England and Northern Ireland. Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty Images\nSince then, Musk has made a series of incendiary comments about the situation in the U.K. on X. At one point, he suggested the violence taking place on British streets could end up in a civil war, writing, \"Civil war is inevitable.\" Musk's comments have been denounced by British officials. A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said last week there is \"no justification\" for such comments. Musk also shared an image of a fake headline that was made to look like it had come from \"The Telegraph\" newspaper's website, falsely claiming that the U.K. was building \"detainment camps\" on the Falkland Islands for rioters. He has since deleted the image, which had also been posted by the co-leader of the far-right Britain First party, Ashlea Simon. U.K. officials had already been critical of Musk even before disinformation over the stabbings occurred. In an interview published by the Times newspaper last week, the U.K.'s technology minister, Peter Kyle, said that Musk is \"accountable to no one\" and that dealing with platforms like his can be like negotiating with foreign governments \"simply because of the scale and scope that they have.\"\nRiot police officers push back anti-migration protesters outside on Aug. 4, 2024 in Rotherham, U.K. Christopher Furlong | Getty Images\n\ntitle2:\nElon Musk and Donald Trump's X Spaces event crashes\ndescription2:\nElon Musk and Donald Trump\u2019s joint X Spaces event appears to have crashed Monday afternoon. The conversation between the owner of X and the former President was scheduled for 5 pm PT, but users received an error message when joining at that time.\n\u201cThis Space is not available,\u201d said a message on X when trying to join the Space.\nThe highly anticipated conversation \u2014 which has been promoted by Trump and Musk \u2014 was supposed to mark the former U.S. president\u2019s return to X. The Spaces event, which Musk called a \u201cconversation,\u201d started at 5:42 pm PT. The live event was scheduled to begin at 5 pm PT.\nImage Credits: Screenshot from X\nTrump returned to the social media outlet Monday morning, where he posted for the first time since January 2021 when he was banned from the platform. Some of Trump\u2019s Monday posts promoted the conversation with Musk, while others featured campaign ads and links to the former President\u2019s website. For the last three years, Trump has switched to primarily posting on his own social media platform Truth Social. That said, Trump has been allowed to post on X for nearly two years; shortly after Musk took over Twitter, now X, he reinstated Trump\u2019s Twitter account in November 2022.\nMusk claimed \u201ca massive DDOS attack on X\u201d appeared to have occurred, supposedly the cause of the crashed X Space. The owner of X says the social media platform conducted extensive testing earlier today with 8 million concurrent listeners. Musk kicked off the Space interview by connecting the alleged DDOS attack \u2013 which stands for distributed denial-of-service, in which a bad actor overwhelms an internet server with a flood of artificial traffic \u2013 with opposition to hearing the former President.\n\u201cAs this massive attack illustrates, there\u2019s a lot of opposition to people just hearing what president Trump has to say and so, but i\u2019m honored to have this conversation,\u201d Musk said as the Spaces began.\nThis is not the first instance of an X Space crashing when a political campaign tries to use the platform. In May 2023, Twitter\u2019s technical issues interrupted Ron DeSantis\u2019s 2024 campaign announcement during a Twitter Space session with Elon Musk and venture capitalist David Sacks.\n\ntitle3:\nApple says Patreon must switch to its billing system or risk removal from App Store\ndescription3:\nApple has threatened to remove creator platform Patreon from the App Store if creators use unsupported third-party billing options or disable transactions on iOS, instead of using Apple\u2019s own in-app purchasing system for Patreon\u2019s subscriptions. In a blog post and email to Patreon creators about upcoming changes to membership in the iOS app, the company says it\u2019s begun a 16-month-long migration process to move all creators to Apple\u2019s iOS in-app purchase system by November 2025.\nPatreon also informed creators it will switch them over to subscription billing as of November 2024, but they will be able to decide whether to price their memberships at a higher fee to cover Apple\u2019s commission or decide if they want to absorb the fee themselves. In addition, creators can opt to delay the migration in their Patreon settings to November 2025, the company said. However, if creators choose the latter option, they won\u2019t be able to offer memberships in the iOS app until they adopt Apple\u2019s iOS in-app purchase system, as Apple\u2019s rules will apply as of this November.\nThe announcement serves as another example of how Apple\u2019s App Store rules have been applied unevenly \u2014 an accusation that Apple has faced in the past from critics, including Fortnite maker Epic Games, which sued the tech giant over antitrust issues. While Epic largely lost that lawsuit, as the court ruled Apple was not a monopolist, it did decide the iPhone maker would have to allow links to other payment options inside their apps. As a result, Apple now allows developers to promote their subscriptions via links to a website, but with a 27% commission instead of the standard 30%, or 12% instead of 15% for auto-renewing subscriptions in year two. (Apple\u2019s compliance with the court\u2019s injunction is still being fought in court.)\nDespite Apple\u2019s rules and policies, Patreon had existed in an odd sort of gray area, as some of its subscription-based offerings could be consumed in its app while others could not. Another possible reason for the Patreon exception was due to the fact that many users didn\u2019t come to Patreon itself to discover creators and content, Patreon CEO Jack Conte told tech news site The Verge in 2021. Instead, the discovery took place through other channels. Though the company admitted it didn\u2019t have any sort of special contract with Apple to avoid the App Store fees, the app had been able to skirt Apple\u2019s in-app billing requirements for some time.\nClearly, Patreon is not happy with the recent pressure from Apple to now comply with its policies, as it tells creators that neither of the options presented \u2014 either raising their subscription prices or eating the cost themselves \u2014 is \u201cideal.\u201d\n\u201cMost creators on Patreon use subscription billing,\u201d Patreon\u2019s blog post points out. \u201cOver the past few years, we\u2019ve slowly rolled it out, tackling each hurdle that has come up to ensure that the migration is not disruptive for creators. That\u2019s the way we like to roll out products. Unfortunately, because of Apple\u2019s timelines and constraints, we can\u2019t continue to do it this way. Instead of helping creators move to subscription billing if and when they feel like it\u2019s right for them, we\u2019re now forced to migrate all creators on Apple\u2019s timeline.\u201d\nThe company reminded creators that Apple\u2019s fees only apply to the iOS app and that creators can continue to offer the same prices on the web and Android. It also advised creators to send their fans to a Help Center article that explains iOS fees so subscribers \u201ccan better understand the implications of where they choose to make their purchases.\u201d\nPatreon and Apple were not immediately available for further comment.\n\ntitle4:\nWaymo to begin testing driverless robotaxis on San Francisco freeways\ndescription4:\nWaymo plans to start testing its fully autonomous vehicles with no human safety driver on freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area this week. Its employees will be the first guinea pigs, and initial testing will start outside rush hour with \u201cless than a handful\u201d of vehicles. For those who didn\u2019t already know, Waymo got the approval from California regulators to charge for autonomous rides on the freeway back in March, so this is a step toward achieving that.\nThe move comes as Waymo \u2014 flush with an additional $5 billion investment from Alphabet \u2014 pushes to expand in SF. Last week, Waymo added 10 square miles to its robotaxi service area to include cities surrounding the city, including Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma.\nTechCrunch also recently reported that Waymo is ramping up efforts to access pickup and drop-offs at San Francisco International Airport.\"\n\nResponse:",
