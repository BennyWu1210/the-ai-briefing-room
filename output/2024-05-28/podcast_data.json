That team, formed in 2023, focused on long-term AI risks. OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever announced his departure in a post on X on May 14.\n\"I'm excited to join @AnthropicAI to continue the superalignment mission,\" Leike wrote on X on Tuesday. \"My new team will work on scalable oversight, weak-to-strong generalization, and automated alignment research.\"\nAnthropic is backed by Amazon , which has committed up to $4 billion in funding for a minority stake in the company.\nIn a post following his departure from OpenAI, Leike wrote, \"Stepping away from this job has been one of the hardest things I have ever done, because we urgently need to figure out how to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\"\nAI safety has gained rapid importance across the tech sector since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, ushering in a boom in generative AI products and investments. Some in the industry have expressed concern that companies are moving too quickly in releasing powerful AI products to the public without adequately considering potential societal harm.\nMicrosoft -backed Open AI said Tuesday that it created a new safety and security committee led by senior executives, including CEO Sam Altman. The committee will recommend \"safety and security decisions for OpenAI projects and operations\" to the company's board.\nAnthropic, founded in 2021 by siblings Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei and other ex-OpenAI executives, launched its ChatGPT rival Claude 3 in March. The company has received funding from Google , Salesforce and Zoom , in addition to funding from Amazon.\nWATCH: Anthropic co-founder on AI adoption\n\ntitle1:\nHubSpot shares jump on talks of potential Google deal\ndescription1:\nHubSpot shares rallied 8% on Tuesday after CNBC's David Faber reported that Alphabet is looking at an all-stock offer for the software company.\nReports of a potential deal first surfaced in early April, when Reuters published a story saying Alphabet was talking to advisors about making an offer for HubSpot. Bloomberg followed with a story earlier this month, indicating that talks were progressing.\n\"There have been many reports about HubSpot being in conversations with Google,\" Faber said Tuesday. \"My understanding is absolutely true, all-stock deal for Alphabet to acquire HubSpot.\"\nWith a market cap of about $33 billion, after Tuesday's jump, HubSpot would be by far Alphabet's largest deal ever. Google's biggest acquisition to date was the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility in 2011.\nHubSpot is primarily used for marketing by small- and medium-size businesses. Its products would presumably fill a gap in helping Google provide marketing technology and customer relationship management tools to its customers, potentially bolstering cloud revenue.\nHubSpot shares were up slightly for the year prior to Tuesday's gains, closing the day at $638.39. The stock doubled in value in 2023.\nAlphabet did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. HubSpot declined to comment.\n\u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.\n\ntitle2:\nYouTube's free games catalog 'Playables' rolls out to all users\ndescription2:\nYouTube\u2019s \u201capp store\u201d for games is rolling out more broadly. The company announced on Tuesday that its collection of lightweight, free games dubbed \u201cPlayables\u201d will soon start to appear in the YouTube app for all users, in addition to the YouTube Home page. Previously, the games had been made available to select users for testing before arriving for YouTube Premium subscribers last November.\nBecause they don\u2019t monetize as paid downloads or via in-app purchases, YouTube\u2019s Playables don\u2019t directly challenge the app store model or break Apple\u2019s rules. However, they do compete with the App Store\u2019s free games, which are often downloaded by casual gamers and generate revenue via ads. As the search giant is shifting its focus to integrate AI, there are questions about the technology\u2019s impact on its ads businesses\u2019 cash cow, driven by the sponsored links that appear above search results. Free games on YouTube, in theory, could become another place to serve ads further down the line. For now, though, Google hasn\u2019t signaled its intention to monetize its Playables.\nThe games could, however, provide a distraction for YouTube users in between their browsing and viewing sessions and help keep them engaged with the YouTube app.\nThe lineup of Playables includes a handful of more popular titles like Angry Birds Showdown, Words of Wonders, Cut the Rope, Tomb of the Mask, and Trivia Crack, among others. It also pulls in titles like Stack Bounce, a game that Google offered on its HTML minigames service, and GameSnacks, which had been developed out of its internal incubator, Area 120. With GameSnacks, the goal was to bring gaming to users in emerging markets \u2014 a place where Android dominates.\nToday, there are currently over 75 minigames in the Playables catalog, Google says. Players who use the feature will be able to save their game progress and track their all-time best scores. Not everyone will see the Playables right away, but the feature should complete its rollout in the coming weeks.\nYouTube isn\u2019t the only tech giant looking to expand into gaming. Netflix has been growing its own game catalog through acquisitions, licensing deals and in-house game development. Meanwhile, Fortnite maker Epic Games is looking to leverage new EU regulations to bring its games store to European users. Elsewhere, other unexpected companies are delving into games, too, including, most recently, LinkedIn.\nThese moves highlight how companies are using games to route around App Store commissions while boosting their own bottom lines. Though Netflix\u2019s games are available on the App Store, they require a Netflix subscription \u2014 bought via its website \u2014 to access.\n\ntitle3:\nT-Mobile to acquire most of U.S. Cellular in $4.4 billion deal; U.S. Cellular shares surge\ndescription3:\nThe T-Mobile logo is displayed on a laptop screen and a smartphone, seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland, Feb. 22, 2024.\nShares of U.S. Cellular popped more than 12% Tuesday after T-Mobile announced that it plans to acquire most of the company, including the wireless operator's stores, some of its spectrum assets and its customers in a deal worth $4.4 billion.\nThe deal includes cash and up to $2 billion of debt, according to a press release from T-Mobile. Up to $100 million of the deal's cash portion depends on certain financial and operating metrics being met between its signing and closing, according to a separate press release from U.S. Cellular.\nShares of T-Mobile closed up around 1% for the session after hitting a new high of $168.71 during intraday trading.\nT-Mobile will acquire about 30% of U.S. Cellular's wireless spectrum as part of the deal, according to the U.S. Cellular release. It plans to use that to improve coverage in rural areas while offering better connectivity to U.S. Cellular customers around the United States, the two companies announced. The company said it will allow U.S. Cellular customers to keep their current plans or switch to a T-Mobile plan.\nBoth companies said that U.S. Cellular will retain 70% of its wireless spectrum and towers and will lease space on at least 2,100 additional towers to T-Mobile. The deal will also allow T-Mobile to sign new long-term leases on at least 2,015 U.S. Cellular-owned towers and extend existing leases on about 600 others, U.S. Cellular said in its release.\nThis will give U.S. Cellular customers a \"strong anchor tenant\" for at least 15 years after the deal's close, the company said.\nThe news follows T-Mobile's $1.35 billion acquisition of Ka'ena, the parent company of Mint Mobile. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved that deal in April. T-Mobile merged with Sprint in 2020 in a deal worth $26 billion.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier in May that T-Mobile and Verizon were in talks to \"carve up\" U.S. Cellular's wireless spectrum but said a deal with Verizon on a separate transaction could take longer or fall through.\nThe companies expect the deal to close in mid-2025.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the timing of an earlier Wall Street Journal report. A previous version misstated the month.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon cloud boss Matt Garman inherits business at crossroads over AI\ndescription4:\nIn this article AMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nAttendees walk through an expo hall during Amazon Web Services' Reinvent conference at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 29, 2022. Noah Berger | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\nIn May 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked by an attendee at the annual shareholder meeting how the company was innovating in generative artificial intelligence. OpenAI's ChatGPT had gone viral, and the major tech companies were all rushing products out the door to compete in the emerging world of chatbots and image generators. Jassy responded to the question by touting Amazon Web Services, the cloud unit he'd helped launch 17 years earlier, eventually turning it into the company's main profit engine. AWS, under the leadership of Adam Selipsky, was developing its own AI products, Jassy said, and had the potential to provide critical infrastructure for other companies developing AI services. \"It's very early days in generative AI,\" said Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021. \"It's very high potential, and we're investing quite a bit in it and expect to be a leader.\" For Selipsky, who took over AWS when Jassy was promoted, the days got late quickly. In the most significant shake-up of Jassy's tenure at the helm, Amazon announced last week that Selipsky, 57, was exiting AWS and will be succeeded by Matt Garman, 48, a veteran AWS executive who most recently led sales and marketing. The problem for Selipsky and the challenge for Garman is that Amazon has yet to emerge as a leader in generative AI despite throwing billions of dollars behind OpenAI competitor Anthropic and rolling out its own large language models, or LLMs. In the developer universe and among startups, the company is battling the perception that it's falling behind cloud rivals Microsoft and Google , in addition to lagging OpenAI in developing AI tools. After years of rapid expansion, growth at AWS decelerated to 13% in 2023, down from 37% in 2021 and 29% in 2022, reflecting more conservative spending by businesses on IT and cloud services. Amazon has downsized across the board, including at least two rounds of layoffs at AWS since last year.\nAWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure, but Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. AWS' market share slipped to 31% in the first quarter of this year from 32% three years earlier, while Microsoft Azure jumped to 25% of the market from 19% in 2021, according to Canalys. Google is also picking up share, accounting for 10% of the market, up from 7% in early 2021. In the past few quarters, Microsoft has cited surging demand for AI tools as a catalyst for its momentum. Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told CNBC that Amazon was \"caught flat-footed\" by the generative AI boom. \"It allowed Microsoft Azure to run laps around them, which should not have happened, and ultimately there was a price to pay for that,\" Luria said, referring to Selipsky's departure. Garman's selection for the top job \"indicates Mr. Jassy and perhaps Mr. Bezos believe he's the person most likely to help Amazon close the lead and maybe establish a lead of their own,\" said Luria, who recommends buying Amazon shares.\n'Next generation of leadership'\nA source close to Amazon, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter, described Garman to CNBC as a \"wartime\" leader and said change was needed to get more aggressive in AI. Jassy said in a staff memo announcing the move that he and Selipsky agreed years ago, when they were discussing the role, that Selipsky would \"likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he'd focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership.\" Casey McGee, an AWS spokesperson, told CNBC in a statement that Selipsky is leaving the cloud division in a \"strong position.\" \"The growth, innovation, and profitability of AWS over the past three years speaks for itself, with AWS producing more absolute dollar growth quarter-over-quarter by our numbers so far this year than any other cloud provider,\" McGee said. He said AWS is leading in security and reliability as well as the \"overall breadth and depth of our services.\"\nAmazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky speaks with Anthropic CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei during AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023. Noah Berger | Getty Images\nAmazon's annual shareholder meeting, which took place virtually Wednesday, arrived at a precarious time. It was held just days after Selipsky's departure and was overshadowed by AI-focused events at top tech companies. Last week, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o, a faster model with improved capabilities in text, video and audio. Google followed a day later at its developer conference, rolling out the company's lightest and most efficient AI models. And this week, Microsoft announced new computers with advanced chips designed to run AI features in Windows. During a Q&A session on Wednesday, Jassy was asked twice about the status of Amazon's generative AI efforts. He said the company is \"seeing a lot of momentum\" in generative AI within AWS to where it's now a multibillion-dollar business based on annualized revenue. He reminded shareholders that Amazon owns Alexa, which was a popular consumer offering long before the latest chatbots hit the market. \"If you don't believe there's going to be a really broad personal assistant, you have your head in the sand,\" Jassy said, adding that the company is building a \"much more expansive\" AI model to power Alexa. Amazon has previously said it intends to use generative AI to make Alexa more conversational. CNBC reported on Wednesday that Amazon plans to charge a subscription fee for the more powerful version. Garman joined Amazon in 2005 as an intern, and was hired full time the following year as an early product manager in AWS, working on the core computing service called EC2. He worked his way up to senior vice president in 2020, overseeing sales, marketing and global services. In 2021, after Amazon announced that Jassy would be taking over the CEO role from Bezos, many people speculated that Garman would be named CEO of AWS. Instead, Amazon chose Selipsky, who had previously spent 11 years at Amazon but was running Salesforce's Tableau Software at the time.\nRough patch\nShortly after the transition, the economy turned against AWS. Inflation started to rapidly pick up, leading to a steady rise in interest rates and forcing businesses into capital preservation mode. By mid-2022, Amazon was telling investors that it was \"prepared to help customers optimize their costs\" due to the economic challenges they were facing. AWS acknowledged it was taking a short-term revenue hit to preserve customer relationships over the long term. Then came ChatGPT. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the chatbot in November 2022 and watched it go viral. Months later, Microsoft invested billions more into OpenAI, and became its exclusive cloud partner, giving Amazon's chief cloud rival a new competitive edge. Over the course of the past year, Jassy has gushed about Amazon's opportunities in generative AI, both for offering automated services to advertisers and sellers and in providing technology within AWS for running sophisticated models and workloads. The company has also boasted about the success of AWS' Trainium and Inferentia chips, with Anthropic using them to build and train its models, a process often performed on Nvidia graphics processing units. \"I don't know if any of us has seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure since the cloud, perhaps since the internet,\" Jassy said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in April, speaking about generative AI. But realizing that opportunity is proving to be a major hurdle.\nwatch now\nAWS took months to come out with an AI model that could go up against ChatGPT. The company is now offering its own LLMs as well as those from third parties, including one from Anthropic, which Amazon backed. Last year, Amazon released Q, a chatbot for businesses. An AWS employee, who used Q, told CNBC that it felt underwhelming because the chatbot would respond to queries with information that wasn't particularly relevant or valuable. The employee asked to remain anonymous because he wasn't authorized to speak on the matter. AWS said its Q chatbot has been gaining traction among a range of customers and partners including Accenture, Toyota, GoDaddy and GitLab. Bedrock, which lets users access AI models from Amazon and others, now has tens of thousands of customers and partners, the company said. The week before his departure, Selipsky made some changes to the Q team. He tapped Dilip Kumar, a longtime Amazon executive who helped develop and launch its cashierless checkout technology, to oversee the \"Amazon Q Business set of services,\" according to a memo sent to employees that was viewed by CNBC. Kumar will report to Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of AI and data at AWS. A former AWS employee, who asked not to be named in order to speak about private matters, said the company has limited the ability of some staffers to use AI services like its software tool SageMaker and data visualization tool QuickSight for work internally, citing security reasons. The practice, known as dogfooding, is commonly used at software companies so employees can test products and services for bugs and to help make improvements. AWS said all applications made available to employees are subject to a security review, but it denied that it's restricted staffers' use of Amazon's AI tools. Despite all of its AI challenges, Wall Street continues to rally around Amazon, which last month reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and a more than 200% increase in operating income. Sales at AWS rose 17%, a modest acceleration from the past few quarters. Amazon shares are up 21% this year, topping the 12% gain in the Nasdaq, after jumping 81% in 2023. The stock hit a record earlier this month. Jamie Meyers, a senior investment analyst at Laffer Tengler Investments, which owns shares of Amazon, said he views the leadership transition at AWS as a \"natural progression,\" adding that Garman has \"always been looked at as a successor.\" \"AWS has always been about investing in growth,\" Meyers said, a strategy he said is unlikely to change under Garman. Garman is viewed internally as someone who is highly technical, and is well respected among engineers. At the time Jassy picked Garman to lead the AWS sales organization in 2020, he was looking for a technical leader and a person who \"knew everything inside out,\" another former AWS employee said. Garman's appointment to the role was widely seen internally as a step toward priming him to lead AWS, the person added.
