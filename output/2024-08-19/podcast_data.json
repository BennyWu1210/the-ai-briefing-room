    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday August 20), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nGM cuts 1,000 software jobs as it prioritizes quality and AI\ndescription0:\nGeneral Motors is cutting around 1,000 software workers around the world in a bid to focus on more \u201chigh-priority\u201d initiatives like improving its Super Cruise driver assistance system, the quality of its infotainment platform and exploring the use of AI.\nThe job cuts are not about cost cutting or individual performance, GM spokesperson Stuart Fowle told TechCrunch. Rather, they are meant to help the company move more quickly as it tries to compete in the world of \u201csoftware-defined vehicles.\u201d\nFor example, Fowle said, that could mean moving away from developing many different infotainment features and instead focusing on ones that matter most to consumers.\nThe shuffle comes after GM has struggled with recent software problems. The automaker temporarily halted sales of its new Blazer EV in late 2023 after early vehicles encountered glitches. In June, GM promoted two former Apple executives to run its software and services division. The promotions were meant to fill the gap left by Mike Abbott, another Apple veteran who had joined GM as its executive vice president of software and services. Abbott left GM in March for health reasons.\nThe cuts are being made around the world, though the majority will be in Michigan, according to CNBC and Bloomberg, which first reported the news.\n\u201cAs we build GM\u2019s future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritize the investments that will have the greatest impact. As a result, we\u2019re reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organization,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nDemand for AI is driving data center water consumption sky high\ndescription1:\nThe AI boom is fueling the demand for data centers and, in turn, driving up water consumption. (Water is used to cool the computing equipment inside data centers.) According to FT, in Virginia \u2014 home to the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers \u2014 water usage jumped by almost two-thirds between 2019 and 2023, from 1.13 billion gallons to 1.85 billion gallons.\nMany say the trend, playing out worldwide, is unsustainable. Microsoft, a major data center operator, says 42% of the water it consumed in 2023 came from \u201careas with water stress.\u201d Google, which has among the largest data center footprints, said this year that 15% of its freshwater withdrawals came from areas with \u201chigh water scarcity.\u201d\nWhy can\u2019t data centers recycle water in a closed-loop system? Many do, but much of what they consume is set aside for humidity control, meaning it evaporates. Especially in drier regions, air that\u2019s not humidified can become a strong conductor of static electricity, which is usually bad news for computers.\n\ntitle2:\nWaymo generation 6 robotaxi Geely Zeekr\ndescription2:\nAlphabet-owned Waymo revealed details about its newest \"generation 6\" self-driving technology on Monday. Its new driverless tech, integrated into Geely Zeekr electric vehicles, should be able to handle a wider array of weather conditions without requiring as many costly cameras and sensors on board.\nThe company invited CNBC to its Mountain View, California, garage to see the new robotaxis in development. Satish Jeyachandran, Waymo's vice president of engineering, said the team is \"confident we can bring this generation to market much faster than the prior generation,\" citing advances in machine learning technology and semiconductor performance.\nWaymo's commercial robotaxi service first went live in late 2018 in the U.S. The company previously integrated its driverless systems into Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans and fully electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs.\nExecutives are sharing details about the forthcoming robotaxis as Waymo works to scale its existing service, Waymo One, within the Sunbelt cities of San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, Texas, and Los Angeles.\nToday, Waymo provides around 50,000 paid driverless trips weekly, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. In June, the company dropped its waitlist and opened Waymo rides to any users in San Francisco. Waymo has completed more than 2 million trips to date.\nLast month, Alphabet announced it would invest a fresh $5 billion in its autonomous vehicle unit, which first began as \"project chauffeur\" at Google in 2009.\nJeyachandran told CNBC that the capital will be used mostly for scaling, including adding the new robotaxis to its fleet once Generation 6 testing and validation is complete. He said he anticipates that Waymo's Jaguar I-PACE and Geely Zeekr vehicles will \"coexist.\"\nThe forthcoming Waymo-Zeekr is a boxier ride that has about the same footprint as the existing Waymo I-Pace SUVs.\nHowever, the Zeekr has an interior that may prove more accessible to some riders. It includes a low step, and a high ceiling with more legroom between rows of seats, among other features.\n\ntitle3:\nCould Trump's AI-generated Taylor Swift endorsement be illegal?\ndescription3:\nOn Sunday, former President Donald Trump posted a collection of memes on Truth Social \u2014 the platform owned by his media company \u2014 that make it seem like Taylor Swift and her fans are coming out in support of his candidacy. But as new legislation takes effect, these images could have deeper implications about the use of AI-generated images in political campaigns, especially when those images misrepresent a celebrity\u2019s likeness.\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m seeing a lot of in my practice right now is the rise of AI impersonators across the board for endorsements,\u201d Noah Downs, an IP and entertainment lawyer, told TechCrunch, with the condition that his comments are not legal advice. These fake AI endorsements have become so widespread that even \u201cShark Tank\u201d had to publish a PSA to warn fans about the prevalence of scams that impersonate the show\u2019s investors.\nIn one of the images Trump posted, hordes of young women wear matching \u201cSwifties for Trump\u201d t-shirts. While there is indeed political diversity among the large population of Swift fans, these images appear to be AI-generated \u2014 in fact, these particular images come from a satirical post on X.\nAnother meme that Trump posted is a screenshot from X that depicts Taylor Swift as Uncle Sam, declaring, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d\nImage Credits: Screenshot posted by Donald Trump on Truth Social\nThough the pop icon has not yet commented on the 2024 U.S. presidential election, she came out in support of the Biden-Harris campaign in 2020 and publicly disparaged Trump at the time. Some fans speculated that Swift had subtly endorsed Harris in an Instagram post this month, though this was not the case.\nAs one of the most dominant figures in pop culture, Swift has been subject to her fair share of deepfakes. When non-consensual, explicit AI images depicting Swift went viral on X this year, some lawmakers responded by introducing new bills aiming to protect against deepfakes. Even White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called on Congress to do something.\nEight months later, the landscape of legal protections against misleading synthetic media already looks different. In Tennessee, where Swift\u2019s corporate representation is based, Governor Bill Lee in March signed the trailblazing ELVIS Act into law, which carves out explicit protections for artists against unauthorized AI imitations of their work.\n\u201cThis legislation was passed with bipartisan support, because everyone appears to recognize the problems that AI and misuse of AI tools can present to the public,\u201d Downs said.\nBut since the ELVIS Act is so new, there isn\u2019t precedent for how it could be used to protect artists. Much of the legislation\u2019s language focuses specifically on AI-generated audio that can mimic an artist\u2019s voice, like the viral Drake song that turned out to be fake.\n\u201cI do think that this is going to be a long-term issue that the ELVIS Act is very prescient in taking care of, but we need to have more robust national legislation about it,\u201d Downs said. The only reason why the ELVIS Act may even potentially be at play is because of Swift\u2019s connections to the state, where she has business and real estate holdings.\nAvi D. Kelin, a partner at PEM Law focusing on political law, is not optimistic that the ELVIS Act could apply, since the law appears more concerned with audio-based impersonation than imagery. Instead, he wonders if this could become a federal election integrity concern in the future.\n\u201cThe larger question is whether the Federal Election Commission, which has jurisdiction over political communications, will get involved,\u201d Kelin told TechCrunch. But he said that the FEC doesn\u2019t seem likely to roll out new guidelines on AI-generated political communications this election cycle.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC), however, announced it is moving forward with plans to enact new AI transparency requirements on TV and radio advertisements. But that doesn\u2019t apply to social media posts by politicians running for government office, and social media remains a key component of campaign communications. Meanwhile, research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a British nonprofit focused on online extremism, showed that the volume of AI-generated disinformation increased an average of 130% per month on X over the last year.\nThese disingenuous endorsements matter so much because Swift\u2019s support is perhaps the most coveted celebrity backing a politician can get. Her cultural influence is so vast that her support of a candidate could tip the scales in a tight race \u2014 according to Morning Consult, more than half of adults in the U.S. consider themselves fans of Taylor Swift, while 16% identify as avid fans. Those numbers are staggering given the context that only about two-thirds of eligible Americans cast their vote in the 2020 election.\n\u201cThe [ELVIS Act] is brand new, and the exact parameters will need to be developed by the courts,\u201d said Kelin. \u201cThis would certainly be an interesting test case!\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nAMD to acquire infrastructure player ZT Systems for $4.9B to amp up its AI ecosystem play\ndescription4:\nAMD, the chipmaker hot on the heels of Nvidia in the AI race, today announced a big acquisition to boost its position as an \u201cecosystem\u201d partner for companies building big AI businesses: It is acquiring ZT Systems, which provides compute design and infrastructure for AI, cloud and general purpose computing, for $4.9 billion. The deal is a mix of cash and stock and includes a contingent payment of up to $400 million if certain performance metrics are met.\nThe plan is to incorporate ZT Systems\u2019 computing infrastructure design business. AMD said it will look to sell ZT Systems\u2019 data center infrastructure manufacturing business to \u201ca strategic partner.\u201d\nBased in New Jersey, ZT Systems has been privately held since it was founded in 1994, and has disclosed only one external funding round \u2014 it raised $850 million in debt in 2023, according to PitchBook. It works closely with big chipmakers such as Nvidia and Intel across areas such as server solutions for storage, GPU/accelerators, high-performance computing, 5G and edge computing.\nAMD said the deal will give it a deeper bench of expertise in AI systems design involving not just silicon, but software and systems \u2014 that could help AMD sell more of its chips (and systems powered by its chips) to customers. AMD said it has already invested about $1 billion in building its broader ecosystem.\nThere is a need for that enhanced approach: As AI systems grow more complex, one major priority for big tech companies building and operating them will be to increase the efficiency of their systems for the most compute-heavy aspects such as AI model training and inferencing.\n\u201cOur acquisition of ZT Systems is the next major step in our long-term AI strategy to deliver leadership training and inferencing solutions that can be rapidly deployed at scale across cloud and enterprise customers,\u201d AMD chair and CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, said in a statement. \u201cZT adds world-class systems design and rack-scale solutions expertise that will significantly strengthen our data center AI systems and customer enablement capabilities. This acquisition also builds on the investments we have made to accelerate our AI hardware and software roadmaps. Combining our high-performance Instinct AI accelerator, EPYC CPU, and networking product portfolios with ZT Systems\u2019 industry-leading data center systems expertise will enable AMD to deliver end-to-end data center AI infrastructure at scale with our ecosystem of OEM and ODM partners.\u201d\nZT Systems does not disclose the names of its clients, but it appears to have increased its profile in recent years for providing specialist support in some of the thorniest and most expensive aspects of AI computing architecture design.\nIts CEO Frank Zhang will lead AMD\u2019s manufacturing business. ZT Systems will become a part of AMD\u2019s Data Center Solutions Business Group.\n\u201cWe are excited to join AMD and together play an even larger role designing the AI infrastructure that is defining the future of computing,\u201d said Zhang, CEO of ZT Systems, in a statement. \u201cFor almost 30 years we have evolved our business to become a leading provider of critical computing and storage infrastructure for the world\u2019s largest cloud companies. AMD shares our vision for the important role our technology and our people play designing and building the computing infrastructure powering the largest data centers in the world.\u201d\nZT president Doug Huang will lead the design and customer enablement teams, and both will report to AMD executive vice president and general manager, Forrest Norrod.\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\"\n\nResponse:",
