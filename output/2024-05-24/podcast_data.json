Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday May 27), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth swells by $87 billion in 5 years\ndescription0:\nJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, on March 19, 2024.\nFive years ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang owned a stake in his chipmaker worth roughly $3 billion. After Thursday's rally, which pushed the stock to a record, his holdings now stand at more than $90 billion.\nNvidia late Wednesday reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates, with sales jumping more than 200% for a third straight quarter, driven by demand for artificial intelligence processors.\nHuang also delivered a better-than-expected forecast and indicated to investors that the company sees insatiable demand for its AI graphics processing units, or GPUs. The company signaled its customers, especially the big cloud companies, could get a strong return on their investment in the pricey chips.\n\"We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do,\" Huang said.\nHuang owns about 86.76 million shares of Nvidia, or more than 3.5% of the company's outstanding shares. With the stock rising over 9% to close at a price of nearly $1,038 per share on Thursday, the value of his stake rose by about $7.7 billion.\nNvidia shares have more than doubled this year after tripling in 2023. They are up about 28-fold in the past five years. Huang added shares to his stake in 2022, when the stock hit relative lows before the AI boom.\nHuang, 61, founded the Silicon Valley company in 1993 to build GPUs for 3D gaming. While gaming was the company's biggest business for decades, Nvidia has dipped into other markets, including cloud gaming subscriptions, the metaverse and cryptocurrency mining chips.\nBut Nvidia's fortunes shifted dramatically in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, opening up the concept of generative AI to the broader public. The technology showcased a future in which computers won't just retrieve new information from databases, but can also generate new content and answers to questions from large caches of unsorted data.\nOpenAI does most of its AI development on Nvidia GPUs. As other companies such as Microsoft , Google and Meta bolstered their investments in AI research and development, they needed billions of dollars worth of the latest AI chips to build out their models.\nHuang has been the face of Nvidia and its principal salesperson, constantly extolling the potential and power of using the company's GPUs for building AI.\nNvidia, which has been developing AI software and tools for more than a decade, ended up in prime position to become the top supplier to the biggest technology companies. The company now has about 80% of the market for AI chips, and Huang is among the 20 richest people in the world.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle invests $350 million in Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart\ndescription1:\nGoogle is investing nearly $350 million in Flipkart, becoming the latest high-profile name to back the Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce startup.\nThe Android-maker will also provide Flipkart with cloud offerings as part of the deal, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup said in a brief statement Friday. The Google investment is part of a nearly $1 billion funding round that Flipkart kicked off in 2023. Walmart has led the round, having invested $600 million in it late last year. (Microsoft is also an investor in Flipkart.)\nFlipkart, valued at $36 billion in the new investment, leads the e-commerce market in India, where it serves hundreds of millions of consumers in smaller cities and towns. The startup, which also owns the fashion e-commerce startup Myntra, commands about 48% of the Indian e-commerce market, according to Bernstein.\nFlipkart competes with Reliance Retail, Amazon, SoftBank-backed Meesho and increasingly a number of quick-commerce apps. Reliance Retail \u2014 run by Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani \u2014 operates the largest retail chain in India and is increasingly attempting to put together an e-commerce play. Reliance Retail was valued at $100 billion in a nearly $2 billion investment by QIA, ADIA and KKR last year.\nIndia\u2019s e-commerce market is estimated to be worth $133 billion by next year, according to Bernstein.\n\u201cIndian e-commerce is seeing emergence of challengers across quick/social/vertical commerce. Amazon and Flipkart remain leaders driven by category strengths in mobiles, consumer electronics and appliances. However, unlike large horizontal winners in global e-commerce market, India is likely to see category winners like Blinkit (quick commerce), Meesho (tier 2+ markets) and Nykaa (vertical commerce) as they scale up,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote in a recent note.\nGoogle, which reaches more than half a billion people in India, identifies the South Asian nation as a key overseas market. The company unveiled plans to invest $10 billion in Indian businesses in 2020. (It has since invested $4.5 billion in the telecom operator Jio Platforms, and another $1 billion in Airtel.)\n\ntitle2:\nMistral AI, Anthropic CEOs are the new tech rockstars in AI boom\ndescription2:\nFrench founder of artificial intelligence start-up Mistral AI, Arthur Mensch attends the Viva Technology show at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on May 22, 2024 in Paris, France.\nPARIS \u2014 It's not unusual for well-known technology CEOs to be mobbed by fans or start-up founders looking to make connections at industry conferences around the world.\nBut it wasn't the high-profile names getting swarmed. Instead, it was the founders of some of the world's hottest and newest artificial intelligence startups getting all the attention \u2014 and trying to bat it away.\nVivaTech, one of Europe's biggest tech shows, enjoyed the attendance of Arthur Mensch, the co-founder and CEO of Mistral AI and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\nJust over a year old, Mistral AI is a French startup that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and the backing of Microsoft . The company is valued at $2 billion, but several recent reports suggest that it is seeking more funding at a $6 billion valuation. The astronomical rise of Mistral AI, which develops AI models much like OpenAI, has put the spotlight on its CEO Mensch.\n\ntitle3:\nChinese EV makers continue push into Europe amid tariff threat\ndescription3:\nNio opened a showroom in Amsterdam this week, and Xpeng launched its G9 and G6 sports utility vehicles in France last week. Xpeng also had a car on display at the VivaTech conference in Paris, and BYD likewise showed off one of its vehicles.\nPARIS \u2014 Chinese electric carmakers are expanding into Europe even as politicians raise the possibility of high tariffs on vehicles from the world's second-largest economy.\nThe public marketing efforts come amid an ongoing investigation by the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, into subsidies given to electric vehicle makers in China. The result of this probe could lead to tariffs on Chinese EV imports.\nThe U.S. has already taken such a step, with the Biden administration imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese EV imports.\nChinese EV makers have been aggressively expanding overseas, as they look to challenge Elon Musk's Tesla internationally but also to gain an early lead ahead of established automakers.\nCompanies like BYD have raised concerns about the cutthroat pricing of vehicles. BYD has a car called the Seagull, a small all-electric hatchback that starts at just 69,800 yuan, or less than $10,000. Chinese firms' ability to launch cheap cars could heap pressure on established automakers, which may not be able to match the discounted pricing.\nChina's EV industry has boomed over the years thanks to incentives and support from the Chinese government, which has concerned politicians in Europe and the U.S.\nWhen CNBC asked about potential EU tariffs this week, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire did not confirm that such measures are on the way. But he said his goal is to \"protect our industry and to ensure that on the international stage, there is a level playing field.\"\n\ntitle4:\nFeds add nine more incidents to Waymo robotaxi investigation\ndescription4:\nFederal safety regulators have discovered nine more incidents that raise questions about the safety of Waymo\u2019s self-driving vehicles operating in Phoenix and San Francisco.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an investigation earlier this month into Waymo\u2019s autonomous vehicle software after receiving 22 reports of robotaxis making unexpected moves that led to crashes and potentially violated traffic safety laws. The investigation, which has been designated a \u201cpreliminary evaluation,\u201d is examining the software and its ability to avoid collisions with stationary objects and how well it detects and responds to \u201ctraffic safety control devices\u201d like cones.\nThe agency said Friday it has added another nine incidents since the investigation was opened. Waymo could not be reached for comment; TechCrunch will update the article if the Alphabet-owned company responds.\nWaymo reported some of these incidents. The others were discovered by regulators via public postings on social media and forums like Reddit, YouTube and X. The additional nine incidents include reports of Waymo robotaxis colliding with gates, utility poles, and parked vehicles, driving in the wrong lane with nearby oncoming traffic and into construction zones.\nThe ODI said it\u2019s concerned the robotaxis \u201cexhibiting such unexpected driving behaviors may increase the risk of crash, property damage, and injury.\u201d The agency said that while it\u2019s not aware of any injuries from these incidents, several involved collisions with visible objects that \u201ca competent driver would be expected to avoid.\u201d The agency also expressed concern that some of these occurred near pedestrians.\nNHTSA has given Waymo until June 11 to respond to a series of questions regarding the investigation.\nNHTSA has stepped up its inquiries into automated driving technology. Earlier this month, the agency opened an investigation into autonomous vehicles operated by Amazon-backed Zoox. The investigation was triggered after receiving two reports of the company\u2019s autonomous-equipped Toyota Highlanders being rear-ended by motorcycles after the SUVs unexpectedly triggered the brakes.\"\n\nResponse:",
