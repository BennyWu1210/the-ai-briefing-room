Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

After Thursday's rally, which pushed the stock to a record, his holdings now stand at more than $90 billion.\nNvidia late Wednesday reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates, with sales jumping more than 200% for a third straight quarter, driven by demand for artificial intelligence processors.\nHuang also delivered a better-than-expected forecast and indicated to investors that the company sees insatiable demand for its AI graphics processing units, or GPUs. The company signaled its customers, especially the big cloud companies, could get a strong return on their investment in the pricey chips.\n\"We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do,\" Huang said.\nHuang owns about 86.76 million shares of Nvidia, or more than 3.5% of the company's outstanding shares. With the stock rising over 9% to close at a price of nearly $1,038 per share on Thursday, the value of his stake rose by about $7.7 billion.\nNvidia shares have more than doubled this year after tripling in 2023. They are up about 28-fold in the past five years. Huang added shares to his stake in 2022, when the stock hit relative lows before the AI boom.\nHuang, 61, founded the Silicon Valley company in 1993 to build GPUs for 3D gaming. While gaming was the company's biggest business for decades, Nvidia has dipped into other markets, including cloud gaming subscriptions, the metaverse and cryptocurrency mining chips.\nBut Nvidia's fortunes shifted dramatically in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, opening up the concept of generative AI to the broader public. The technology showcased a future in which computers won't just retrieve new information from databases, but can also generate new content and answers to questions from large caches of unsorted data.\nOpenAI does most of its AI development on Nvidia GPUs. As other companies such as Microsoft , Google and Meta bolstered their investments in AI research and development, they needed billions of dollars worth of the latest AI chips to build out their models.\nHuang has been the face of Nvidia and its principal salesperson, constantly extolling the potential and power of using the company's GPUs for building AI.\nNvidia, which has been developing AI software and tools for more than a decade, ended up in prime position to become the top supplier to the biggest technology companies. The company now has about 80% of the market for AI chips, and Huang is among the 20 richest people in the world.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle invests $350 million in Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart\ndescription1:\nGoogle is investing nearly $350 million in Flipkart, becoming the latest high-profile name to back the Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce startup.\nThe Android-maker will also provide Flipkart with cloud offerings as part of the deal, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup said in a brief statement Friday. The Google investment is part of a nearly $1 billion funding round that Flipkart kicked off in 2023. Walmart has led the round, having invested $600 million in it late last year. (Microsoft is also an investor in Flipkart.)\nFlipkart, valued at $36 billion in the new investment, leads the e-commerce market in India, where it serves hundreds of millions of consumers in smaller cities and towns. The startup, which also owns the fashion e-commerce startup Myntra, commands about 48% of the Indian e-commerce market, according to Bernstein.\nFlipkart competes with Reliance Retail, Amazon, SoftBank-backed Meesho and increasingly a number of quick-commerce apps. Reliance Retail \u2014 run by Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani \u2014 operates the largest retail chain in India and is increasingly attempting to put together an e-commerce play. Reliance Retail was valued at $100 billion in a nearly $2 billion investment by QIA, ADIA and KKR last year.\nIndia\u2019s e-commerce market is estimated to be worth $133 billion by next year, according to Bernstein.\n\u201cIndian e-commerce is seeing emergence of challengers across quick/social/vertical commerce. Amazon and Flipkart remain leaders driven by category strengths in mobiles, consumer electronics and appliances. However, unlike large horizontal winners in global e-commerce market, India is likely to see category winners like Blinkit (quick commerce), Meesho (tier 2+ markets) and Nykaa (vertical commerce) as they scale up,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote in a recent note.\nGoogle, which reaches more than half a billion people in India, identifies the South Asian nation as a key overseas market. The company unveiled plans to invest $10 billion in Indian businesses in 2020. (It has since invested $4.5 billion in the telecom operator Jio Platforms, and another $1 billion in Airtel.)\n\ntitle2:\nMistral AI, Anthropic CEOs are the new tech rockstars in AI boom\ndescription2:\nFrench founder of artificial intelligence start-up Mistral AI, Arthur Mensch attends the Viva Technology show at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on May 22, 2024 in Paris, France.\nPARIS \u2014 It's not unusual for well-known technology CEOs to be mobbed by fans or start-up founders looking to make connections at industry conferences around the world.\nBut it wasn't the high-profile names getting swarmed. Instead, it was the founders of some of the world's hottest and newest artificial intelligence startups getting all the attention \u2014 and trying to bat it away.\nVivaTech, one of Europe's biggest tech shows, enjoyed the attendance of Arthur Mensch, the co-founder and CEO of Mistral AI and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\nJust over a year old, Mistral AI is a French startup that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and the backing of Microsoft . The company is valued at $2 billion, but several recent reports suggest that it is seeking more funding at a $6 billion valuation. The astronomical rise of Mistral AI, which develops AI models much like OpenAI, has put the spotlight on its CEO Mensch.\n\ntitle3:\nBig tech companies are plowing money into AI startups, which could help them dodge antitrust concerns\ndescription3:\nAnother week, and another round of crazy cash injections and valuations emerged from the AI realm.\nDeepL, an AI language translation startup, raised $300 million on a $2 billion valuation; Scale AI, a data-labeling platform for machine learning models, secured $1 billion as its valuation nearly doubled to $13.8 billion; and H, a fledgling French startup working on its own frontier models, raised an eye-watering $220 million seed round at an undisclosed valuation (though it surely takes H comfortably into unicorn territory).\nWhile all the usual institutional investors are present, such as Accel, Index, and Y Combinator (YC), these investments really underscore the corporate clamber to get in on the action while keeping regulators at arm\u2019s length.\nThe quasi-merger\nTake Scale AI, a company that had so far attracted purely institutional and angel investors from its inception in 2016 through its Series E round in 2021. Similar investors returned for the Series F, but also in tow were Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and the VC arms of Intel, AMD, Cisco, and ServiceNow.\nOn the same day as Scale AI announced its chunky Series F investors, H showed its hand: Amazon had bought in too, alongside Samsung\u2019s VC arm and UiPath, an automation software company worth $10 billion today.\nCorporate investment in AI startups has been a big story in the last couple years, best exemplified by Microsoft\u2019s close affinity with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. That deal has attracted scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the European Union and the U.K., drawn by growing concerns that Big Tech is adopting a new \u201cquasi-merger\u201d tactic that seeks control and influence over nascent technologies without buying them outright \u2014 this might be through hiring founding startup teams, for instance, or though strategic investments.\nMicrosoft is said to own a 49% stake in OpenAI, meaning there could well be a case to answer once European regulators have concluded their initial investigations \u2014 regardless of whether Microsoft has voting clout in OpenAI or not.\nAnthropic could find itself in a similar position. The three-year-old company has raised north of $7 billion from numerous investors, with corporates such as Google, SAP, and the venture arms of Salesforce and Zoom throwing cash into the pot. But Amazon, specifically, is responsible for more than half of Anthropic\u2019s fundraising to date, concluding a $4 billion investment in March. Even though its investment has not given Amazon a majority stake (similar to Microsoft with OpenAI), U.K. antitrust regulator the CMA last month confirmed it was looking at the deal to establish whether it might qualify for an antitrust investigation.\nAt the same time, the CMA also revealed it was looking into Microsoft\u2019s recent acqui-hire of Inflection AI (a year after Microsoft became Inflection\u2019s biggest backer) which saw Microsoft scoop up its founders and key colleagues to run a new consumer AI unit, leaving a bare-bones Inflection AI focused on the enterprise segment.\nThe CMA also confirmed it was investigating Microsoft\u2019s recent $16 million investment in French AI startup Mistral. But the regulator swiftly concluded that the deal didn\u2019t qualify for investigation due to its relative size.\n\u201cThe CMA has considered information submitted by Microsoft and Mistral AI, together with feedback received in response to its invitation to comment,\u201d a CMA spokesperson said at the time. \u201cBased on the evidence, the CMA does not believe that Microsoft has acquired material influence over Mistral AI as a result of the partnership and therefore does not qualify for investigation.\u201d\nWhile Nvidia hasn\u2019t historically been shoehorned into the same \u201cBig Tech\u201d bracket as these aforementioned companies, it has emerged as one of the major players in the AI gold rush, and its clout can\u2019t be overstated: the company was valued at a not-insignificant $770 billion this time last year, but this figure has ballooned to more than $2.5 trillion in the intervening months. This positions Nvidia as the third most valuable company globally, behind Microsoft ($3.17 trillion) and Apple ($2.87 trillion), but ahead of Meta ($1.18 trillion), Amazon ($1.88 trillion), and Alphabet ($2.15 trillion).\nNvidia has invested in AI startup Hugging Face, alongside Amazon, Google, Qualcomm, Intel, and others. Elsewhere, Nvidia has bought stakes in Cohere, Perplexity AI, Inflection AI, Cohesity, Mistral AI, Weka, Wayve, and a host of other AI startups.\nBig Tech is showing no sign of easing on its AI startup investment ethos, in the hope that procuring smaller equity stakes might just get them a regulatory pass. But that\u2019s not to say that the juggernauts of Silicon Valley and Seattle won\u2019t be able to exert some form of control over these companies \u2014 they are stakeholders, after all, and can influence startups in all manner of subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle's AI Overview catches heat for absurd, factual errors\ndescription4:\nIt's been less than two weeks since Google debuted \"AI Overview\" in Google Search, and public criticism has mounted after queries have returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature \u2014 without any way to opt out.\nAI Overview shows a quick summary of answers to search questions at the very top of Google Search. For example, if a user searches for the best way to clean leather boots, the results page may display an \"AI Overview\" at the top with a multistep cleaning process, gleaned from information it synthesized from around the web.\nBut social media users have shared a wide range of screenshots showing the AI tool giving incorrect and controversial responses.\nGoogle, Microsoft, OpenAI and other companies are at the helm of a generative AI arms race as companies in seemingly every industry rush to add AI-powered chatbots and agents to avoid being left behind by competitors. The market is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\nHere are some examples of errors produced by AI Overview, according to screenshots shared by users.\nWhen asked how many Muslim presidents the U.S. has had, AI Overview responded, \"The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama.\"\nWhen a user searched for \"cheese not sticking to pizza,\" the feature suggested adding \"about 1/8 cup of nontoxic glue to the sauce.\" Social media users found an 11-year-old Reddit comment that seemed to be the source.\nAttribution can also be a problem for AI Overview, especially in attributing inaccurate information to medical professionals or scientists.\nFor instance, when asked, \"How long can I stare at the sun for best health,\" the tool said, \"According to WebMD, scientists say that staring at the sun for 5-15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes if you have darker skin, is generally safe and provides the most health benefits.\"\nWhen asked, \"How many rocks should I eat each day,\" the tool said, \"According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day,\" going on to list the vitamins and digestive benefits.\nThe tool also can respond inaccurately to simple queries, such as making up a list of fruits that end with \"um,\" or saying the year 1919 was 20 years ago.\nWhen asked whether or not Google Search violates antitrust law, AI Overview said, \"Yes, the U.S. Justice Department and 11 states are suing Google for antitrust violations.\"\nThe day Google rolled out AI Overview at its annual Google I/O event, the company said it also plans to introduce assistant-like planning capabilities directly within search. It explained that users will be able to search for something like, \"Create a 3-day meal plan for a group that's easy to prepare,\" and they'd get a starting point with a wide range of recipes from across the web.\n\"The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. \"Many of the examples we've seen have been uncommon queries, and we've also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn't reproduce.\"\nThe spokesperson said AI Overview underwent extensive testing before launch and that the company is taking \"swift action where appropriate under our content policies.\"\nThe news follows Google's high-profile rollout of Gemini's image-generation tool in February, and a pause that same month after comparable issues.\nThe tool allowed users to enter prompts to create an image, but almost immediately, users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.\nFor instance, when one user asked Gemini to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era, according to screenshots on social media platform X.\nWhen asked for a \"historically accurate depiction of a medieval British king,\" the model generated another racially diverse set of images, including one of a woman ruler, screenshots showed. Users reported similar outcomes when they asked for images of the U.S. founding fathers, an 18th-century king of France, a German couple in the 1800s and more. The model showed an image of Asian men in response to a query about Google's own founders, users reported.\nGoogle said in a statement at the time that it was working to fix Gemini's image-generation issues, acknowledging that the tool was \"missing the mark.\" Soon after, the company announced it would immediately \"pause the image generation of people\" and \"re-release an improved version soon.\"\nIn February, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said Google planned to relaunch its image-generation AI tool in the next \"few weeks,\" but it has not yet rolled out again.\nThe problems with Gemini's image-generation outputs reignited a debate within the AI industry, with some groups calling Gemini too \"woke,\" or left-leaning, and others saying that the company didn't sufficiently invest in the right forms of AI ethics. Google came under fire in 2020 and 2021 for ousting the co-leads of its AI ethics group after they published a research paper critical of certain risks of such AI models and then later reorganizing the group's structure.\nIn 2023, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, was criticized by some employees for the company's botched and \"rushed\" rollout of Bard, which followed the viral spread of ChatGPT.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect the correct name of Google's AI Overview. Also, an earlier version of this article included a link to a screenshot that Google later confirmed was doctored.\"\n\nResponse:",
