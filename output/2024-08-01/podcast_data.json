Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday August 2), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nIntel to lay off 15,000 employees\ndescription0:\nIntel announced it would layoff more than 15% of its staff, or 15,000 employees, in a memo to employees on Thursday. The massive headcount is part of a large plan to reduce spending by $10 billion in 2025, following a dismal second quarter earnings report and outlook.\n\u201cOur revenues have not grown as expected \u2013 and we\u2019ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI,\u201d said CEO Pat Gelsinger in a memo to employees. \u201cOur costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both \u2013 particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.\u201d\nAs Gelsinger describes, Intel has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom in the same way other hardware companies, such as Nvidia, have. Intel led the tech industry\u2019s revolution around CPU chips roughly 25 years ago, but has been slow to embrace newer waves of computing such as smartphones and AI. Gelsinger says annual revenues at Intel fell $24 billion between 2020 and 2023, despite its workforce growing 10% in the same time frame. That\u2019s a stark contract to other chipmakers during the AI boom, who have seen revenues and valuations soar to astronomical heights.\nIntel reported a 1% decline in revenues for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. The company attributed the loss to gross margin headwinds related to its AI PC products. The company is also suspending its shareholder dividend starting in the fourth quarter of 2024, and anticipates \u201cmore challenging\u201d second-half trends than it previously expected.\nBeyond the layoffs, Intel will broadly offer applications for a \u201cvoluntary departure\u201d program next week to employees at the company, according to the memo. The company is also announcing a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft now lists OpenAI as a competitor in AI and search\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft has a long and tangled history with OpenAI, having invested a reported $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker as part of a long-term partnership. As part of the deal, Microsoft runs OpenAI\u2019s models across its enterprise and consumer products and is OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud provider.\nHowever, the tech giant called the startup a \u201ccompetitor\u201d for the first time in an SEC filing on Tuesday.\nIn Microsoft\u2019s annual 10K, OpenAI joined a long list of competitors in AI, alongside Anthropic, Amazon, and Meta. OpenAI was also listed alongside Google as a competitor to Microsoft in search, thanks to OpenAI\u2019s new SearchGPT feature announced last week.\nIt\u2019s possible Microsoft is trying to change the narrative on its relationship with OpenAI in light of antitrust concerns \u2014 the FTC is currently looking into the relationship, alongside similar cloud provider investments into AI startups. Microsoft recently agreed to give up its board observer seat at the startup \u2014 a seat it gained after a kerfuffle last fall when OpenAI\u2019s board briefly fired CEO Sam Altman, prompting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to offer him and other top execs jobs at Microsoft.\nHowever, SEC filings like this are often places where corporations throw out hyper-cautious warnings to investors.\nPartners and competitors are certainly not mutually exclusive titles in Silicon Valley. In the year 2000, the dominant search engine at the time, Yahoo, announced an agreement to let Google\u2019s search results appear on its web page. The two companies were partners for a few years, until Google ate Yahoo\u2019s lunch in search and became the unofficial, but dominant, doorstep to the internet. The two companies were partners, but were still threats to each other. (Yahoo is the owner of TechCrunch.)\nThere\u2019s enough history of this kind of power-switch in tech that it\u2019s at least conceivable that Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s relationship will take a similar route.\nRegardless, Microsoft is not putting all its eggs in one basket.\nIn March, Microsoft hired the co-founders of billion-dollar AI startup Inflection AI, Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, to lead its new Microsoft AI division. The cloud provider is investing heavily into Microsoft Copilot and building out an AI future that\u2019s entirely separate from OpenAI.\n\ntitle2:\nAI music startup Suno claims training model on copyrighted music is 'fair use'\ndescription2:\nFollowing the recent lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) against music generation startups Udio and Suno, Suno admitted in a court filing on Thursday that it did, in fact, train its AI model using copyrighted songs. But it claimed that doing so was legal under the fair-use doctrine.\nThe RIAA filed the lawsuit against Udio and Suno on June 24, alleging that the companies trained their models using copyrighted music. While Suno\u2019s investors have previously hinted that the startup didn\u2019t have permission from the music labels to use the copyrighted material, it hasn\u2019t been so directly stated as it was in today\u2019s filing.\n\u201cIt is no secret that the tens of millions of recordings that Suno\u2019s model was trained on presumably included recordings whose rights are owned by the Plaintiffs in this case,\u201d the filing states.\nSuno CEO and co-founder Mikey Shulman continued on in a blog post published the same day as the legal filing, saying \u201cWe train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet\u2026 Much of the open internet indeed contains copyrighted materials, and some of it is owned by major record labels.\u201d\nShulman also argued that training its AI model from data on the \u201copen internet\u201d is no different than a \u201ckid writing their own rock songs after listening to the genre.\u201d\n\u201cLearning is not infringing. It never has been, and it is now now,\u201d Shulman added.\nThe RIAA clapped back with this response: \u201cIt\u2019s a major concession of facts they spent months trying to hide and acknowledged only when forced by a lawsuit. Their industrial scale infringement does not qualify as \u2018fair use\u2019. There\u2019s nothing fair about stealing an artist\u2019s life\u2019s work, extracting its core value, and repackaging it to compete directly with the originals\u2026Their vision of the \u2018future of music\u2019 is apparently one in which fans will no longer enjoy music by their favorite artists because those artists can no longer earn a living.\u201d\nThe question of fair use was never simple, but with AI model training even established doctrine may not be applicable. The outcome of this case, still in its early stages, will likely establish an influential precedent that could define the future of more than just the two startups named in it.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon\u2019s advertising business grew 20% in the second quarter\ndescription4:\nAmazon's online advertising business brought in $12.77 billion during the second quarter, marking a 20% year-over-year increase, but missing analysts' estimates.\nAmazon disclosed the latest quarterly financial results of its online advertising unit on Thursday when it reported its second-quarter earnings. The company's overall second-quarter sales were $147.98 billion, trailing analysts' estimates of $148.56 billion.\nAnalysts were expecting Amazon to report online advertising sales of $13 billion. The company's online advertising unit is still small relative to its core online retail business, but it is quickly growing and changing the digital advertising industry, in which Meta and Alphabet still dominate.\nIndeed, Meta's online advertising sales continue to improve after a tough 2022 when Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that weakened the company's ad-targeting system, along with smaller social media rivals such as Snap and Pinterest.\nOn Wednesday, however, Meta reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations and indicated that the company has rehabilitated its advertising technology. Indeed, Meta said second-quarter overall sales, the bulk of which comprises advertising, increased 22% year over year to $39.07 billion.\"\n\nResponse:",
