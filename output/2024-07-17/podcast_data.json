Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Amazon is holding its Prime Day event this week across many regions.\nAdobe\u2019s report noted that consumers spent $7.2 billion on the first day as compared to $6.4 billion on the first day in 2023. It said that the first day of the Prime Day event Tuesday was the biggest e-commerce sales day of the year, as well as the biggest mobile shopping day of the year, with consumers spending $3.5 billion from their mobile devices.\nAdobe said that its Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) option clocked 17.1% growth year-on-year driving $540 million in sales.\nAs compared to sales in June 2024, some categories registered higher sales such as headphones and Bluetooth speakers (164%), electronics (33%), televisions (83%), fitness trackers (81%), tablets (71%), e-readers (65%) and computers (64%). Other growing categories were video games (up 134%), small kitchen appliances (up 82%) and perfume and cologne (up 49%).\nAccording to analytics site The Numerator, the average order size on Prime Day 2024 so far is $60.03. In comparison, the average order size of the past two years\u2019 events were $56.64 and $53.14, respectively.\nThe Adobe Analytics reports predicts a record $14 billion online spend across the two-day event with 10.5% year-on-year.\nThe report noted that the higher sales numbers are due to new demand and not due to rising prices of items.\n\u201cStrong consumer spending this year has been driven by net-new demand, as opposed to higher prices. The Adobe Digital Price Index, which tracks online prices across 18 product categories, shows that e-commerce prices have fallen for 22 months now \u2014 down 4.2 percent YoY in June 2024,\u201d the report said.\n\ntitle1:\nGlobal chip stocks from Nvidia to ASML fall as geopolitics, Trump weigh\ndescription1:\nGlobal chip stocks fell sharply, with ASML , Nvidia and TSMC posting declines amid reports of tighter export restrictions from the U.S. and a ramp-up of geopolitical tensions fueled by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump.\nASML's Netherlands-listed shares were down 11%, while Tokyo Electron shares in Japan closed nearly 7.5% lower. Arm , AMD , Marvell , Qualcomm and Broadcom closed down more than 7%.\nThe moves came after Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that the Biden administration is considering a wide-sweeping rule to clamp down on companies exporting their critical chipmaking equipment to China.\nWashington's foreign direct product rule, or FDPR, allows the U.S. to put controls on foreign-made products even if they use the smallest amount of American technology. This can affect non-U.S. companies.\nCNBC has reached out to the U.S. State Department, the Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for comment on the report.\n\ntitle2:\nAnthropic, Menlo Ventures launch $100 million Anthology Fund for AI\ndescription2:\nAnthropic and one of its biggest investors are taking a page from Apple's playbook.\nThe artificial intelligence startup and Menlo Ventures are launching a $100 million fund on Wednesday to back early-stage startups, and get them using the AI company's technology. Menlo will put up the cash to invest in the startups, while Anthropic will give founders $25,000 in credits that go toward using its large language models.\nThe launch of the Anthology Fund mirrors a partnership between Apple and venture firm Kleiner Perkins. The joint venture, called the iFund, was introduced in 2008, a year after the iPhone hit the market, to support developers on Apple's mobile platforms. It initially started with $100 million in 2008, and doubled to $200 million two years later.\nMatt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and a former partner at Kleiner Perkins, said the iFund was the inspiration for this launch.\n\"That was wildly successful \u2014 it really gave Apple a lens into a whole set of early developers, and what they need to be more attentive to,\" Murphy told CNBC. \"It also gave developers a direct lens into some of the things that Apple was thinking about selling. There's a lot of parallels here.\"\nThe big difference, Murphy said, is that AI is moving faster than iPhone development. He said this current wave of AI is happening 10 to 100 times quicker than \"what was previously the biggest wave of innovation we've seen.\"\nVenture capitalists are now looking for ways to sweeten their offers to court AI startups, as investors swarm to the hottest deals. Funding for AI startups more than doubled in the second quarter from the first, topping $24 billion, according to data from Crunchbase.\nAnthropic is offering coaching, quarterly meetups and other resources, including what amounts to a hotline directly to the company, or what Murphy described as a \"bat phone.\"\nBut Anthropic won't write any equity checks, or get a financial stake in the startups. Daniela Amodei, who co-founded Anthropic with her brother, Dario, after leaving rival OpenAI, said the company wants to establish a feedback loop. The more Anthropic partners with developers, the more it can improve its own products.\n\"In AI, it's very expensive to get started \u2014 it can actually be a deterrent to launching your company,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"Our goal here is to contribute that component. We're providing credits and also some guidance on how to get started in the ecosystem.\"\nAnthropic can also benefit from having the next generation of high-flying AI companies building on its underlying infrastructure. Anthropic directly competes with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.\nOpenAI has its own venture fund, the OpenAI Startup Fund, which its website says is \"investing $175 million to help AI companies have a profound, positive impact on the world.\"\nMurphy differentiated the Anthology Fund, and said, \"it's hard to provide alignment with another strategic partner.\"\n\"It's a unique opportunity for Anthropic, for us and a set of entrepreneurs that we're going to be funding over the next couple of years to be part of this, build a great community, learn together, do some of the most disruptive, innovative things and really build something great,\" Murphy said.\n\ntitle3:\nTTT models might be the next frontier in generative AI\ndescription3:\nAfter years of dominance by the form of AI known as the transformer, the hunt is on for new architectures.\nTransformers underpin OpenAI\u2019s video-generating model Sora, and they\u2019re at the heart of text-generating models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Google\u2019s Gemini and GPT-4o. But they\u2019re beginning to run up against technical roadblocks \u2014 in particular, computation-related roadblocks.\nTransformers aren\u2019t especially efficient at processing and analyzing vast amounts of data, at least running on off-the-shelf hardware. And that\u2019s leading to steep and perhaps unsustainable increases in power demand as companies build and expand infrastructure to accommodate transformers\u2019 requirements.\nA promising architecture proposed this month is test-time training (TTT), which was developed over the course of a year and a half by researchers at Stanford, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley and Meta. The research team claims that TTT models can not only process far more data than transformers, but that they can do so without consuming nearly as much compute power.\nThe hidden state in transformers\nA fundamental component of transformers is the \u201chidden state,\u201d which is essentially a long list of data. As a transformer processes something, it adds entries to the hidden state to \u201cremember\u201d what it just processed. For instance, if the model is working its way through a book, the hidden state values will be things like representations of words (or parts of words).\n\u201cIf you think of a transformer as an intelligent entity, then the lookup table \u2014 its hidden state \u2014 is the transformer\u2019s brain,\u201d Yu Sun, a post-doc at Stanford and a co-contributor on the TTT research, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis specialized brain enables the well-known capabilities of transformers such as in-context learning.\u201d\nThe hidden state is part of what makes transformers so powerful. But it also hobbles them. To \u201csay\u201d even a single word about a book a transformer just read, the model would have to scan through its entire lookup table \u2014 a task as computationally demanding as rereading the whole book.\nSo Sun and team had the idea of replacing the hidden state with a machine learning model \u2014 like nested dolls of AI, if you will, a model within a model.\nIt\u2019s a bit technical, but the gist is that the TTT model\u2019s internal machine learning model, unlike a transformer\u2019s lookup table, doesn\u2019t grow and grow as it processes additional data. Instead, it encodes the data it processes into representative variables called weights, which is what makes TTT models highly performant. No matter how much data a TTT model processes, the size of its internal model won\u2019t change.\nSun believes that future TTT models could efficiently process billions of pieces of data, from words to images to audio recordings to videos. That\u2019s far beyond the capabilities of today\u2019s models.\n\u201cOur system can say X words about a book without the computational complexity of rereading the book X times,\u201d Sun said. \u201cLarge video models based on transformers, such as Sora, can only process 10 seconds of video, because they only have a lookup table \u2018brain.\u2019 Our eventual goal is to develop a system that can process a long video resembling the visual experience of a human life.\u201d\nSkepticism around the TTT models\nSo will TTT models eventually supersede transformers? They could. But it\u2019s too early to say for certain.\nTTT models aren\u2019t a drop-in replacement for transformers. And the researchers only developed two small models for study, making TTT as a method difficult to compare right now to some of the larger transformer implementations out there.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfectly interesting innovation, and if the data backs up the claims that it provides efficiency gains then that\u2019s great news, but I couldn\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s better than existing architectures or not,\u201d said Mike Cook, a senior lecturer in King\u2019s College London\u2019s department of informatics who wasn\u2019t involved with the TTT research. \u201cAn old professor of mine used to tell a joke when I was an undergrad: How do you solve any problem in computer science? Add another layer of abstraction. Adding a neural network inside a neural network definitely reminds me of that.\u201d\nRegardless, the accelerating pace of research into transformer alternatives points to growing recognition of the need for a breakthrough.\nThis week, AI startup Mistral released a model, Codestral Mamba, that\u2019s based on another alternative to the transformer called state space models (SSMs). SSMs, like TTT models, appear to be more computationally efficient than transformers and can scale up to larger amounts of data.\nAI21 Labs is also exploring SSMs. So is Cartesia, which pioneered some of the first SSMs and Codestral Mamba\u2019s namesakes, Mamba and Mamba-2.\nShould these efforts succeed, it could make generative AI even more accessible and widespread than it is now \u2014 for better or worse.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft's AI-powered, Canva-like Designer app lands on iOS and Android\ndescription4:\nMicrosoft announced on Wednesday that its AI-powered Designer app is officially coming out of preview and is now available to all users on iOS and Android. The Canva-like app lets people generate images and designs with text prompts to create things like stickers, greeting cards, invitations, collages and more.\nDesigner is now accessible in more than 80 languages on the web, available as a free mobile app and as an app in Windows.\nThe app features \u201cprompt templates\u201d that are designed to help jumpstart the creative process. The templates include styles and descriptions that you can experiment with and customize, and you can share templates with others in order to build on each other\u2019s ideas.\nIn addition to stickers, you can create emojis, clip art, wallpapers, monograms, avatars and more with text prompts.\nYou can also use Designer to edit and restyle images with AI. For instance, you can upload a selfie and then choose from a set of styles and write in any extra details you want to see to transform your photo.\nImage Credits: Microsoft\nSoon, Designer will include a \u201creplace background\u201d feature that will allow you to use text prompts to transform images.\nWith the launch of the standalone Designer app, Microsoft shared that it\u2019s bringing the service to apps like Word and PowerPoint through Copilot. People who have a Copilot Pro subscription can create images and designs in their workflow. Soon, users will get the option to create a banner for their document in Word based on the content of their document.\nAs part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Microsoft revealed that Microsoft Photos on Windows 11 is getting a deeper integration with Designer. Users can now use AI to edit photos without leaving the Photos app. You can now do things like erase objects, remove backgrounds and auto-crop images directly within the app.\"\n\nResponse:",
