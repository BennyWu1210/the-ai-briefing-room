Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday July 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla shares close down 8% after report of robotaxi unveiling delay\ndescription0:\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, speaks during the Milken Global Conference 2024 at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on May 6, 2024.\nTesla shares closed down about 8% on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that the electric vehicle maker is delaying the unveiling of its Robotaxi by two months.\nAfter previously announcing that it would introduce its robotaxi on Aug. 8, Tesla has pushed the launch back to October to give teams working on the project more time to build prototypes, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the decision.\nTesla did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nTesla's stock slump on Thursday followed an 11-day rally that was sparked by a better-than-expected deliveries report for the second quarter. That jump wiped out the stock's loss for the year. However, the shares are now back in negative territory for 2024, a year that has been marred by sweeping layoffs and a drop in sales due in part to an aging lineup of EVs and increased competition in China.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has promised shareholders a robotaxi for years. In 2015, he said Tesla's cars would achieve \"full autonomy\" within three years. In 2016, Musk said Tesla would be able to send one of its cars on a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention by the end of the following year.\nThe empty promises continued into 2019, when Musk said on a call with institutional investors that Tesla would have one million robotaxi-ready vehicles on the road in 2020. However, the company has yet to deliver a robotaxi, autonomous vehicle or technology that can turn its cars into \"level 3\" automated vehicles. Meanwhile, companies such as Alphabet's Waymo and Cruise, owned by General Motors , have leaped ahead of Tesla.\nFollowing a dreary first-quarter earnings report in April, Musk reiterated his vision of Tesla as a company dedicated to developing robotaxis that will make money for their owners and a driverless transportation network.\n\"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\" Musk said on the earnings call. The company is scheduled to report second-quarter results later this month.\nAt Tesla, \"unveil\" dates do not predict a near-future date for a commercial release of a new product. For example, Tesla unveiled its fully electric heavy-duty truck, the Semi, in 2017, and did not begin deliveries until December 2022.\n\u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.\nWATCH: The bulls firmly have control of Tesla right now\n\ntitle1:\nSoftBank acquires UK AI chipmaker Graphcore\ndescription1:\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but Graphcore CEO Nigel Toon says it\u2019s a positive outcome (for most). Full regulatory approval has been granted already, meaning this is final.\nU.K. chip company Graphcore has been formally acquired by Japan\u2019s SoftBank.\nRumors of the deal have abounded for some time, but protracted negotiations and regulatory approvals have meant neither company has confirmed anything until now. Even today, the company wouldn\u2019t confirm the one thing most people will be wondering: How much does Japanese multinational SoftBank value a startup touted as a potential rival to the mighty Nvidia in the AI chip space?\nWhile the figure of $500 million has been bandied around in various reports for months, in a press briefing early Thursday morning, Graphcore co-founder and CEO Nigel Toon remained coy on the details. \u201cWe have agreed with SoftBank that we\u2019re not going into the details of the deal; whether anything comes out in the future, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Toon said.\nToon did say, however, that the $500 million figure was inaccurate. Make of that what you will.\nWhen the chips are down\nFounded out of Bristol in 2016, Graphcore has devised a new kind of processor dubbed an \u201cintelligence processing unit\u201d (IPU), distinct to the kinds of graphics processing units (GPU) developed by the likes of Nvidia. While both accelerate computation, IPUs have a different architecture designed from the ground-up for AI workloads. Graphcore pitches its chips as a more efficient alternative to GPUs, with a focus on supporting large-scale parallel processing and executing complex machine learning models, where the model and data are tightly coupled.\nGraphcore had raised around $700 million since its inception, reaching a valuation just shy of $3 billion in late 2020. With big-name corporate and institutional investors like Microsoft and Sequoia, and angels such as DeepMind\u2019s Demis Hassabis and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, hopes were high that Graphcore could be an AI beacon in the U.K. or even all of Europe. But AI hardware is a resource-intensive business, and Graphcore ultimately couldn\u2019t hit the giddy heights many had hoped it could reach. It lost out on potential lucrative cloud deals with Microsoft, while the U.K.\u2019s own government ignored Graphcore (despite a public plea from Toon himself) for its new \u201cexascale\u201d computer plans last year.\nGraphcore has not had the best of times of late, compounded last year by its forced China exit due to U.S. export rules.\nWith losses widening and Graphcore approaching four years since its last capital injection, it was increasingly clear that something had to happen somewhere \u2014 and an acquisition always seemed the most likely outcome, particularly at a time when demand for AI hardware is at fever pitch.\nSoftBank, for its part, is no stranger to U.K. semiconductor companies, having previously acquired Arm for \u00a324 billion ($31 billion) and then retained a stake as it spun Arm out as a $55 billion publicly traded company last year. Arm is now worth close to $200 billion \u2014 a sign, perhaps, that SoftBank might not be the worst bedfellow for Graphcore, as the well-financed Japanese powerhouse seeks to bolster its AI aspirations with everything from data centers and robotics, to the semiconductors needed to power the AI revolution.\nCertainly, this is how the folks at Graphcore view matters. While those on the outside might view the sale to SoftBank as a missed opportunity for a U.K. or European company to create an independent AI hardware giant, Toon\u2019s tone in Thursday\u2019s briefing was one more of upbeat positivity.\nFor starters, Toon confirmed that he doesn\u2019t expect any layoffs as a result of this acquisition, across its U.K., Polish and Taiwanese hubs, adding that, if anything, it will likely be adding \u201cquite significantly\u201d to its headcount in the U.K.\nAnd importantly, both he and CTO co-cofounder Simon Knowles will be staying put both in their executive and directorship roles.\nGraphcore co-founder and CTO Simon Knowles. Image Credits: Graphcore\nHowever, in most people\u2019s eyes, Graphcore hasn\u2019t really fulfilled its early promise. So what happened?\nIn a nutshell, the expenditure required in the space that Graphcore operates is an order of magnitude higher than what Graphcore was able to access as an independent company.\n\u201cSimon and I sat in a pub back in 2012 talking about this: AI, and the hardware that will be required for AI,\u201d Toon told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about this and what\u2019s required for a long period of time, and we\u2019ve probably been one of the early thinkers in the whole space. I think the piece that has surprised us [most] is the speed at which this has all taken off, and the scale that is involved.\u201d\nThis \u201cscale,\u201d Toon says, involves systems of 100,000 interconnected AI processors, networking, liquid cooling and all the rest; it\u2019s not exactly child\u2019s play, and it\u2019s far from cheap.\n\u201cThis is a level of investment which is utterly massive, and the piece which is really interesting here is Graphcore is a relatively modest-sized company \u2014 large in terms of U.K. investments, but still modest in terms of the companies we\u2019re competing with \u2014 and we\u2019ve managed to go toe-to-toe and build world-class technology.\u201d\nGraphcore was always relatively demure in terms of headcount. For comparison, Nvidia has in the region of 30,000 employees, whereas Graphcore has around 500. And while Nvidia has grown organically over some three decades, Graphcore was trying to scale at a time when the post-pandemic capital markets weren\u2019t friendly to startups of Graphcore\u2019s disposition.\n\u201cThe right outcome for the company here is to work closely with a partner who\u2019s willing to make these levels of investments that are required to succeed in what is going to be probably the most important market in technology over the coming years,\u201d Toon said.\nTime will tell whether the acquisition proves a prudent move for the companies concerned, but Toon did confirm reports this week that some former employees\u2019 stock was wiped out in this deal. This suggests that the acquisition price was below (or around) the figure it had raised, as investors and senior executives would be more likely to hold preferred stock options over ex-employees. Indeed, Toon confirmed that he did make some money from the transaction, without disclosing how much.\nToon also stressed that for all current employees and investors, the deal was a relatively positive outcome \u2014 for those willing to hang around, at least.\n\u201cThere are a number of ways you can structure M&A deals. Sometimes that means that former employees don\u2019t participate in what happens going forward, and unfortunately that\u2019s the case here,\u201d Toon said. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry about that, but what I can say is, for all of Graphcore current employees, and the people who will be working with the company going forward, this is a great outcome for all of those. [And] it\u2019s a good outcome for our investors. They\u2019re all very happy.\u201d\nGraphcore gets the green light from regulators\nOften when acquisitions of this magnitude are announced, there are months or even years of prolonged regulatory tussles. But here, SoftBank and Graphcore have gone through all the necessary antitrust and security approvals already; as a major infrastructure company, a deal such as this was always going to draw scrutiny under the U.K.\u2019s National Security and Investment Act, which came into force two years ago.\n\u201cWe have been through a very rigorous process of receiving all of the regulatory approvals for this deal, which is maybe why things have been rumored for some period of time,\u201d Toon said. \u201cAll the approvals are in place, in the U.S. and other places as well.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s it: Graphcore is now officially owned by SoftBank, operating as a wholly owned subsidiary under its existing Graphcore name. The company\u2019s headquarters will remain in Bristol, with additional hubs in London and Cambridge in the U.K., as well as offices in Gdansk (Poland) and Hsinchu (Taiwan).\nWhat happens next for Graphcore as a SoftBank subsidiary is up in the air, but Vikas J. Parekh, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, stresses that Graphcore will now play a big part in its pursuit of AI riches.\n\u201cSociety is embracing the opportunities offered by foundation models, generative AI applications and new approaches to scientific discovery,\u201d Parekh said in a press release issued to TechCrunch. \u201cNext-generation semiconductors and compute systems are essential in the AGI [artificial general intelligence] journey; we\u2019re pleased to collaborate with Graphcore in this mission.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nApple reaches deal with EU to open up mobile payments system to rivals\ndescription2:\nThe European Union flag displayed on a mobile phone screen in front of the Apple logo on July 2, 2024.\nEU antitrust regulators on Thursday accepted commitments from Apple to allow access to its tap-and-go payments technology to rivals, bringing an end to a four-year investigation.\n\"The commission has decided to accept commitments offered by Apple. These commitments address our preliminary concerns that Apple may illegally have restricted competition when it comes to mobile wallets on iPhones,\" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said during a news conference.\nThe EU formally launched an investigation relating to Apple Pay in 2020. The probe looked at the terms and conditions Apple sets for integrating Apple Pay in apps and websites as well as concerns around the tap-and-go technology and alleged refusals of accessing Apple Pay.\nIn 2022 the European Commission found that Apple Pay could restrict competition as it was the only option for iPhone users. Apple has since suggested several commitments to address the concerns and in January it offered to give its rivals access to its contactless payment and mobile wallet technology.\nApple committed to allowing third-party developers access to NFC technology without charging them, providing access to key iPhone features like Face ID to competing payment wallets, and to allow users to set any wallet of their choice as the default option, Vestager explained.\nEarlier this year the European Commission market tested Apple's commitments to collect feedback on the proposals. Following its assessment, the commission concluded that Apple's final commitments address concerns regarding the tech giant's restrictions of allowing third-parties access to its tap-and-go payments technology. The changes have now been made legally binding on Apple.\n\"The commitments bring important changes to how Apple operates in Europe to the benefit of competitors and customers,\" Vestager said.\n\"From now on, Apple can no longer use its control over the iPhone ecosystem to keep other mobile wallets out of the market. Competing wallet developers, as well as consumers, will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice, while keeping payments secure,\" she added.\nThe iPhone maker now has until July 25 to implement the commitments, Vestager said. All developers will then be able to offer mobile wallets for iPhones with the tap-and-go technology, she explained. The commitments are set to remain in effect for 10 years.\n\"Apple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and contactless transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets from within their iOS apps using Host Card Emulation based APIs,\" Apple said in emailed comments.\nIt added that there would be no changes to Apple Pay or the Apple Wallet following the probe.\n\ntitle3:\nDefense AI startup Helsing raises $487M Series C, plans Baltic expansion to combat Russian threat\ndescription3:\nDefense AI startup Helsing has raised \u20ac450 million ($487 million) in a Series C financing round led by General Catalyst. It now plans to expand its presence in European nations bordering Russia. The announcement came as NATO held its annual summit in Washington, D.C., where the Russian invasion of Ukraine is high on the agenda.\nAs per the above plan, Helsing has created a new entity in Estonia and plans to spend \u20ac70 million on Baltic defense projects over the next three years. The Germany-HQ company also has offices in Munich, London and Paris, and said the new cash injection would be spent developing its AI capability and expanding from its 300-employee base.\nHelsing creates AI software to process information from defense systems, boost weapons capabilities in drones and jet fighters, and improve battlefield decisions.\nGundbert Scherf, Helsing\u2019s co-chief executive officer, said in an interview with TechCrunch that \u201cUkraine has used technology for its defense against the full-scale Russian invasion, and I think us being able to help there and deploy our technology and execute the mission we had set out three and a half years ago, to use AI to protect our democracies, has been a big driver for us.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a company founded on European values and defending European interests and democracies, and right that now is happening in Ukraine,\u201d he said, speaking about the move into Estonia. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s also happening on our eastern flank, all the way from Finland, through the Baltics, down to Poland \u2026 Estonia is a country that\u2019s obviously also a leader in technology and the prime minister there has a high conviction in protecting European democracies. So it was a natural starting point.\u201d\nIn a statement, Kaja Kallas, Estonia\u2019s prime minister, said that Helsing\u2019s entrance was \u201cvery welcome\u201d in her country and that \u201cwe need actions, not just words.\u201d\n\u201cRussia has increased its defense budget to 7% of GDP, to a level where it\u2019s pretty clear that the goal is probably not just Ukraine, but wider,\u201d co-CEO Torsten Reil added. \u201cWe feel a sense of urgency and responsibility to create a capability gap in order to be able to deter and, if necessary, defend Europe and the NATO eastern flank.\u201d\nAsked where Helsing gets the bulk of its AI compute from, the company co-CEOs demurred on the details. Reil said: \u201cWe use our own compute obviously. We\u2019re on \u2018Edge\u2019 devices, and there\u2019s always local compute required as well. We also announced a few weeks ago Project Centaur, which is based on reinforcement learning to create an AI for air combat. That requires a lot of compute. So we spend a lot of money right now on training and training agents. Eventually, we\u2019ll have extremely high capabilities in air combat. And there we use scaled-up compute.\u201d\nHowever, Reil said that while they have some compute capability, the company also uses third parties, but he said these cannot be named for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d\nTo date, Helsing has won deals with Airbus SE and defense ministries in Germany and Ukraine, including the German Eurofighter Electronic Warfare upgrade (with strategic investor and committed partner Saab AB), the AI infrastructure for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS, with consortium HIS) and a number of classified contracts in the maritime and land domains, the company said in a statement.\nThe latest funding round would theoretically value the company in the region of \u20ac4.95 billion ($5.4 billion) according to a source who spoke to Bloomberg, but the company has declined to comment on matters of valuation.\nThe startup is plowing an increasingly popular furrow for startups as defense tech rockets up the agenda of Western investors both concerned at the war footing of Russia and the possible threat from China. Silicon Valley put almost $35 billion into defense tech startups in 2023, and over $9 billion so far this year, according to a report released last week by PitchBook.\nAt the same time, Western defense budgets are going up, creating an opportunity for founders and investors in the space.\nHowever, while a U.S. equivalent to Helsing might be Anduril Industries Inc., few other European defense startups have managed to get to Helsing\u2019s scale, in part because European government defense spending still lags behind that of the U.S.\nThe new funding means that to date Helsing has raised \u20ac769 million in total from investors including Spotify founder Prima Materia (the fund set up by Spotify founder Daniel Ek) and Swedish defense supplier Saab AB.
