Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday September 4), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple Event 2024: iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence and all the other expected 'Glowtime' reveals\ndescription0:\nSometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn\u2019t invite us to fly across the country for a single product \u2014 not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it\u2019s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays.\nThe livestream kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the \u201cGlowtime\u201d tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most.\nApple Intelligence and Siri\nBack at WWDC in June, Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name \u2014 Apple Intelligence \u2014 which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The \u201csmall model\u201d method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it\u2019s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience.\nThat\u2019s a marked difference between it and much larger \u201cblack box\u201d models like OpenAI\u2019s and Google\u2019s Gemini. The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence\u2019s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as \u2014 at the very least \u2014 all of generative AI is, at the end of the day.\nThe answer for how this all ties into \u201cGlowtime\u201d can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced a much-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant. Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing.\nOut of every iPhone ever launched, two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence: the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that\u2019s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter.\nWith all of this in mind, next week\u2019s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line.\niPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max\nImage Credits: Stanislav Kogiku / SOPA Images / LightRocket / Getty Images\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature the thinnest bezels on a smartphone \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/rK9LEugcb1 \u2014 Apple Hub (@theapplehub) September 1, 2024\nWe\u2019re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what\u2019s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you\u2019re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out.\nThat will reportedly bump the Pro Max\u2019s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device\u2019s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches.\nCamera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunch is a new glass molded lens that is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don\u2019t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart.\nLeaked dummy models from early in the year give us a rough idea of each model\u2019s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new \u201cCapture\u201d button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities.\nThe most welcome change, however, may be bigger batteries. Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additional reports, meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks.\nThe Pro models are also expected to gain Wi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard.\nApple Watch Series 10/Ultra 3\nImage Credits: Apple\nAs hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it\u2019d have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor \u2014 something especially important when discussing a watch.\nLike the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor \u2014 the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn\u2019t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but as Bloomberg notes, Apple\u2019s legal woes with Masimo may well trip up that feature.\nA long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week.\nAirPods 4\nImage Credits: Apple\nStay with me on this one. Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its products to comply with EU mandates.\nSo, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We\u2019ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we\u2019re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however, finally get the over-ear AirPods Max 2, four years after the original.\nNew Macs\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThis one is a big maybe. Recent reporting suggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac\u2019s release calendar ever since the pandemic. A big, USB-A-less version of the Mac Mini is said to be arriving before end of year, along with a new iMac and MacBook Pro.\nGlow with the flow\nImage Credits: Apple\nHere\u2019s what we can say for sure: Apple\u2019s Glowtime event is scheduled for Monday, September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. As always, we\u2019ll be there, bringing it to you live.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia slides in post-market trading after drop wiped out almost $300 billion\ndescription1:\nNvidia shares fell 2% in extended trading Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that the company received a subpoena from the Department of Justice as part of an antitrust investigation.\nThe slide comes after Nvidia dropped nearly 10% during regular trading, wiping $279 billion off its market cap.\nThe DOJ probe has not reached the stage of a formal complaint, according to Bloomberg, and the agency is asking questions about whether Nvidia makes it harder to switch to other suppliers of AI chips. Nvidia has more than 80% of the market for data center AI chips, according to industry estimates.\nNvidia's huge rise in recent years has been directly tied to its dominance in AI chips for data centers, established years before competitors AMD and Intel started taking the category seriously. Nearly a decade ago, Nvidia developed a programming language for its chips, called CUDA, which is a key tool for engineers who train advanced AI models like the one at the heart of ChatGPT.\nMany of Nvidia's top customers are cloud companies as well as internet giants, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs Nvidia's AI chips have become a hot commodity, the company has released new enterprise software subscriptions and marketed its networking products as important complements to get the most out of its chips.\nRecent versions of Nvidia's chips can come pre-installed in entire Nvidia-designed server racks, an example of Nvidia's effort to move from being a mere parts supplier to an entire systems provider.\nA representative for Nvidia told CNBC that the company \"wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, who can choose whatever solution is best for them.\" The DOJ declined to comment to CNBC.\n\ntitle2:\nSnapchat to put ads next to chats with friends\ndescription2:\nSnapchat will soon start \u201cexperimenting\u201d with placing sponsored messages next to chat threads from friends, according to CEO Evan Spiegel.\nThese \u201cSponsored Snaps\u201d from brands will appear as unread messages in Snapchat\u2019s main Chat tab, implying that they\u2019ll sit above messages from a person\u2019s contacts until they\u2019re acted on. This is the first time Snap will show ads in the most used part of its app.\nIn an employee memo also posted on the company\u2019s website, Spiegel says that Sponsored Snaps will appear \u201cwithout a push notification, and opening the message is optional.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how easy it will be to get rid of a Sponsored Snap without opening it, or if doing so will even be possible. (Snap declined to comment beyond Spiegel\u2019s memo.)\n\u201cSponsored Snaps empower advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community, making the core functionality of Snapchat accessible to advertisers,\u201d writes Spiegel, who goes on to note that, \u201cAs always, your conversations with friends are private and are not used for advertising purposes.\u201d\nTo understand why Snap is doing this now, look no further than its stock price, which is hovering near an all-time low. Despite now reaching over 850 million monthly users globally, Snap\u2019s ads business is still tiny compared to its biggest competitors, including Meta. Snap also still isn\u2019t profitable.\n\ntitle3:\nNeko Health, the body-scanning AI health startup from Spotify's Daniel Ek, opens in London\ndescription3:\nPrevention is better than cure, as the saying goes. Today, a splashy startup that has taken that concept to heart \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 is expanding.\nNeko Health was co-founded by Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne with a mission to improve preventative healthcare with annual full body scans and AI-powered insights that can detect conditions like heart disease and skin cancer. Now, the Swedish company is launching in London, its first city outside of its home market.\nFor \u00a3299 and an hour of your time, the company runs a series of scans and tests that it says creates \u201cmillions\u201d of datapoints that help determine your state of health across a range of cardiovascular, metabolic, and other conditions. An in-person meeting with a doctor to discuss the data is included in the session. Those interested in getting in line for a visit can sign up here.\nThe company is coming to the U.K. on the heels of a strong start in Stockholm, where it has opened two clinics in its first year of operation. To date, it has scanned 2,707 people, and while 78.5% of them were found to have no health issues, results for some 14.1% of visitors raised issues that required further medical treatment. Some 1%, it said, were identified to have \u201csevere\u201d cardiovascular, metabolic, or cancerous conditions. Of that group, none were aware of their conditions prior to visiting Neko, the company said.\nNeko is Japanese for \u201ccat\u201d and Nilsonne tells me that it\u2019s a reference to cats having nine lives, or more specifically a lot of lucky breaks. \u201cThat\u2019s how we would hope that our system feels for our users,\u201d he said.\nA visit to the Neko clinic\nDespite the participation of a major tech figure like Ek, the company\u2019s ethos is actually very understated. As a result, it sometimes gets in its own way.\nWhen I visited the London clinic to go through the testing process to write this article, it took me a few trips up and down a London street to realise that I had walked straight past the Neko clinic, which was marked only by its logo \u2014 an N sliced and shifted through its waistline \u2014 at the top of a glass doorway. The rest of the operation is below ground level, making the street-level lobby look more like a discreet entry to a fancy apartment block rather than a health center.\nOnce you enter the building and descend the stairs, you enter an equally sparse lobby with pared-down furniture, muted colours and lighting, and low-volume, soothing electronic music piped throughout. The concept is somewhere between elegant day spa and futuristic medical clinic.\nOnce there, you\u2019re funnelled through their system. An assistant takes a few notes about you before leading you into a room where you strip down to your underpants, a robe, and slippers. A second assistant then measures your height and weight before moving you to a cylindrical chamber that feels like a cross between a tanning booth and a security scanner at an airport.\nThe chamber itself is fitted with 70 sensors, including dozens of volumetric and other cameras, to produce a composite picture of you with 50 million data points. From there, you move to an examination bed, where you have another two scans, measurements of your eye pressure and blood pressure, and a grip test. Finally, the the clinician draws a blood sample.\nThe blood sample is the only invasive test that Neko carries out, and altogether the experience takes under an hour. Soon after, you change and are taken to a separate consultation room where a doctor goes through your data.\nNeko\u2019s focus is on risks and proactive prevention rather than existing conditions. Data points are grouped and presented along the lines of different potential problems you might encounter related to them \u2014 among them skin cancer (my moles were counted and it seems that I have many more than the average person), high blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome (a group of conditions that can lead to illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes).\nIf the data reveals problems, you\u2019re referred for more diagnostics and channeled to doctors for further examinations.\nUnlikely beginnings\nNilsonne tells me that Ek first approached him to chat about healthcare over a Twitter direct message.\nThe year was 2018, and Nilsonne\u2019s company at the time \u2014 an AI-powered,smart home energy monitoring startup \u2014 was running out of money and winding down after failing to find product-market fit with the big energy companies it expected to be its customers.\n\u201cThen out of nowhere, I get a direct message on Twitter from Daniel.\u201d Ek had just taken audio streaming platform Spotify through an IPO and was a newly minted billionaire looking for another thorny problem to solve, something that would have \u201ca positive contribution to the world,\u201d in Nilsonne\u2019s words. He\u2019d gotten it into his head that he wanted to reinvent healthcare, just as he\u2019d reinvented recorded music consumption with Spotify.\n\u201cSo he reached out to me. We didn\u2019t know each other, but he was aware of what I had been doing, working with hardware and software and AI.\u201d\nEk offered to fund a startup with Nilsonne at the head on the spot, but Nilsonne at first rejected him. Neither of them have a medical background. But Nilsonne does come from a family of doctors so it\u2019s in his consciousness, and Ek was obsessed, so the two kept talking, and they could see something starting to take shape.\nWearables like Fitbits and Apple Watches, Nilsonne said, have led to an \u201cincredible explosion of abundance of high-quality health information.\u201d Combining that with AI and the ability to draw \u201csensible conclusions\u201d from all this data, \u201cit was very clear that we could create a different healthcare system.\u201d Thus began five years of building prototypes for the physical clinics and their component hardware, as well as the software to analyse the data.\nNeko itself, plus its co-founders Nilsonne and Ek, come from an unlikely location. Sweden is home to one of the world\u2019s most famous socialised medicine programs. You might assume that the existence of free, and good, healthcare would make a paid service like Neko a hard sell to consumers. But so far at least, the opposite has been true.\nWhen the company last year announced a $60 million funding round, it had a waiting list of \u201cthousands\u201d lined up to get scans. Now that list is up to 22,000.\nYes, some of that might be down to Neko being the latest project from one of Sweden\u2019s most famous living entrepreneurs (who is also one of Neko\u2019s major investors by way of his investment vehicle, Prima Materia). But Nilsonne believes Neko is addressing an important gap that will give the startup staying power.\nThe majority of healthcare services, including those in Sweden and the U.K., are focused on treating conditions rather than preventative care. But because our populations are aging, the number of conditions that need treatment are rapidly increasing, and that\u2019s putting the whole system under pressure \u201cin an unsustainable way,\u201d Nilsonne said, explaining that 75% of healthcare costs go towards chronic diseases.\n\u201cOur hypothesis is that prevention and early detection could to be the things that would solve a lot of these problems. Most chronic conditions are fully preventable, or you can delay them by decades if you have effective early interventions. But of course, in our system, you basically show up when you already have the disease, and then it\u2019s too late to reverse them, and there are a lot of costs associated with it.\u201d\n(It is far from being the only startup focusing on preventative healthcare technology. Zoi in France and Germany\u2019s Aware are two in Europe. In the U.K., the NHS does offer a Health Check that covers many of the same areas that Neko does, although as Nilsonne points out, it\u2019s less frequent.)\n\u201cThe NHS health check is available only once every five years to individuals aged 44 to 74,\u201d Nilsonne points out. \u201cIt offers a much narrower range of tests and does not include a consultation with a doctor to discuss the results. We know from our data that chronic diseases are increasingly appearing in individuals under 44\u201d \u2014 which also happens to be the average age of a Neko customer \u2014 \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s crucial to adopt a proactive approach to health to identify potential issues early, take corrective action, and monitor progress over time.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nTesla will need some Hollywood magic for its robotaxi reveal\ndescription4:\nThe news that Tesla will likely reveal its long-awaited, much-debated autonomous robotaxi at the Warner Bros. movie studio in Los Angeles underscores how much ground the company needs to cover in order to catch up to its rivals in the self-driving space. It also inadvertently provides a ready-made metaphor for the types of Hollywood trickery Elon Musk and Co. will no doubt need to employ in order to convince their supporters that Tesla\u2019s driverless technology is really ready this time.\nOver the weekend, Bloomberg reported that Tesla was planning on using the film studio\u2019s lot in Burbank, California, to reveal its next-generation robotaxi on October 10th. (The event was originally supposed to take place on August 8th but was pushed back after Musk ordered more work on the prototype.)\nTesla needs to catch up to its rivals in the self-driving space\nIt was an interesting decision considering Tesla mostly likes to hold these types of events on its own turf. But as Bloomberg noted, the 110-acre lot contains over two dozen sound stages, including fake suburban towns that could be an ideal location to test a not-quite-ready-for-primetime autonomous vehicle. These include row houses, brownstones, and a virtual small downtown \u2014 all ready-made for a robotaxi demonstration.\nThe report gained further credence after a Tesla software hacker known online as @greentheonly noted on X that the company had started gathering mapping data in and around the movie studio a few days prior to the report. Green, who has gained some notoriety in Tesla circles by going through the source code of Tesla\u2019s software updates, said the company was also collecting data around other locations, including the still-under-construction Tesla Diner in Santa Monica and \u201cvarious SF and Bay Area pieces.\u201d\nThe revelation that Tesla is collecting data on these areas in advance of its robotaxi event suggests a couple of things. First, the company wants to ensure that its demonstration of driverless technology goes off flawlessly, so it\u2019s mapping the areas in which it could operate. That seems like sound reasoning. Tesla has a lot riding on this event given recent comments by Musk that the company should be seen as primarily a robotics company.\n\u201cWe are an AI, robotics company; if you value us otherwise, the right answer is impossible to the questions being asked,\u201d Musk said earlier this year.\nRerouting the company from its core business of making and selling electric vehicles to robotics and autonomy is crucial for Musk, especially as Tesla\u2019s sales continue to sag globally. Tesla\u2019s market cap is equal to almost all the other global automaker\u2019s value combined. Much of this value is based on Musk\u2019s promises to not only drive the electrification of the auto industry but also \u201csolve\u201d autonomy by releasing a truly revolutionary vehicle that can drive itself. Whatever Tesla reveals on October 10th needs to prove this is possible.\nTesla has a lot riding on this event\nAny Tesla fan would be quick to point out that all the other autonomous vehicle operators also gather geographic data before launching their robotaxis. Waymo, Cruise, and all the others focus on making their autonomous driving systems work in geofenced areas of cities. But as Electrek rightly points out, Tesla has always claimed that its system would be different by using data gathered from its fleet of regular vehicle owners, who send camera images back to the company for annotation and labeling.\nWith all that data, Musk has boasted that Tesla would be unrestrained by any geographic limitations. In other words, true \u201cLevel 5\u201d autonomy \u2014 a driverless car that could drive anywhere, under any conditions.\nOf course, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re getting on October 10th. Tesla is likely to show a pretty good demo of a driverless car tooling around on the Warner Bros. lot, or around downtown San Francisco, or at the Supercharger location in Santa Monica. But the idea that any Tesla owner would be able to push a button and send their driverless vehicle out into the world to start collecting passive income as a robotaxi anytime soon is ludicrous.\nThat\u2019s because of all the glaring holes in Tesla\u2019s approach to autonomy. For one, the company got rid of its radar and ultrasonic sensors and now only relies on cameras as part of its sensor suite. This approach lacks the redundancy that is a key component of higher-level autonomous systems that include radar, ultrasonic, and lidar to render a 3D environment around the vehicle. If some debris or mud hits one or more of the cameras, the vehicle would essentially be riding blind. That\u2019s not going to work for a lot of people.\nThere are glaring holes in Tesla\u2019s approach to autonomy\nThis also reinforces previous reporting that Tesla\u2019s \u201cdata annotators\u201d have been giving \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to Musk and several Tesla influencers when training the neural nets for its autonomous system, according to a Business Insider investigation. This suggests that the company\u2019s efforts at developing a truly autonomous system are being misapplied and perhaps aren\u2019t sufficient for what Tesla claims to be attempting.\nAnother glaring hole in Tesla\u2019s approach to self-driving is legal liability. To date, the company has been unwilling to accept any liability for crashes involving the company\u2019s driver-assistance features, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. In fact, Musk even laughed off a question as to whether his company would accept legal liability for its self-driving vehicles in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who assume we have legal liability,\u201d Musk has said, \u201cjudging by the lawsuits.\u201d\nThis strategy has worked so far. Last year, Tesla won a lawsuit that tried to blame Autopilot for a 2019 crash. But if the company attempts to deploy fully driverless vehicles, like Waymo or Cruise, it\u2019s difficult to see how it can continue to avoid liability. There have been thousands of crashes involving the company\u2019s vehicles with Autopilot and at least 44 deaths. Even one death in a Tesla autonomous vehicle would be a disaster.\"\n\nResponse:",
