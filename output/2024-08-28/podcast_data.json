Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday August 29), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI reportedly in talks to close a new funding round at $100B+ valuation\ndescription0:\nChatGPT creator OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise a massive tranche of cash led by previous backer Thrive Capital, at a valuation of more than $100 billion. That\u2019s substantially higher than OpenAI\u2019s previous $86 billion valuation, and by far the highest valuation of any AI startup to date.\nThrive will reportedly throw in around $1 billion for its part. Microsoft is also expected to participate, according to the WSJ, which has the story. It\u2019s unclear would join the round. Khosla Ventures, Infosys and Y Combinator are among OpenAI\u2019s other existing backers.\nThe financing is poised to serve as OpenAI\u2019s biggest outside infusion of capital since January 2023, when Microsoft invested nearly $10 billion.\nOpenAI needs the money. The WSJ says its annualized revenue eclipsed $3.4 billion early this year. The Information says OpenAI is on track to lose nearly $5 billion by year end, however, and that it has already burned through $8.5 billion on AI training and staffing.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle\u2019s custom AI chatbots have arrived\ndescription1:\nGoogle will soon let Gemini subscribers create custom chatbots that can serve as a gym buddy, cooking partner, writing editor, and more. Users can give the chatbots \u2014 called Gems \u2014 distinct personalities and specialties by simply describing a set of instructions.\nGoogle first introduced Gems during I/O in May. In an example prompt shown by Google, users can create a \u201cknowledgeable, casual, and friendly\u201d Gem that can help people plan low- or no-water gardens. For users who don\u2019t want to create a custom chatbot right away, Google is offering some premade Gems, including a learning coach, an idea brainstormer, a career guide, a coding partner, and an editor.\nYou can give Gems a name and a set of instructions. GIF: Google\nGoogle is rolling out Gems to Gemini Advanced, Gemini Business, and Gemini Enterprise users on mobile and desktop devices in over 150 countries and \u201cmost\u201d languages.\n\ntitle2:\nSEC issues Wells notice to NFT marketplace OpenSea\ndescription2:\nIn this photo illustration an OpenSea logo is displayed on a smartphone with stock market percentages in the background.\nCrypto marketplace OpenSea has been added to the SEC's list of targets, as the regulator extends its crackdown on the sector.\nThe company's CEO said in a post on X on Wednesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice against OpenSea.\nA Wells notice is typically one of the final steps before the SEC issues formal charges. It generally lays out the framework of the regulatory argument and offers the potentially accused an opportunity to rebut the SEC's claims.\nThe letter, according to the OpenSea chief, alleges that the nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, sold on its platform are securities. OpenSea is a popular platform that allows users to create, sell and buy NFTs.\nOpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote in a post that the company was \"shocked the SEC would make such a sweeping move against creators and artists\" but that they are \"ready to stand up and fight.\"\nFinzer calls it a \"move into uncharted territory.\"\n\"By targeting NFTs, the SEC would stifle innovation on an even broader scale: hundreds of thousands of online artists and creatives are at risk, and many do not have the resources to defend themselves,\" he added, noting that the company has pledged $5 million to cover legal fees for NFT creators and developers who receive a Wells notice.\nOpenSea directed CNBC to a blog post by Finzer, in addition to the social media post. In it, the OpenSea CEO adds that classifying NFTs as securities would \"misinterpret the law\" and that he is confident his company \"operates legally\" and that its \"users aren't trading securities.\"\nSo far this year, the SEC has sent Wells notices, filed lawsuits, or reached settlements with a host of crypto firms focused on ethereum and decentralized finance, including ShapeShift, TradeStation and Uniswap. The agency is also reportedly investigating the Ethereum Foundation.\nCentralized exchanges and trading platforms Coinbase , Kraken, Binance, and Robinhood have also all been engaged in legal battles with the regulator.\nIn May, investment platform Robinhood announced it received a Wells notice for the company's crypto operations. The SEC has also sued Coinbase and Binance. Meanwhile, a California judge on Friday ruled that the commission's case against Kraken would proceed to trial.\nWith multiple pending legal challenges from the regulator and enduring uncertainty about the future of crypto regulation in the U.S., some crypto businesses have said they are considering decamping from the country altogether.\nSEC chair Gary Gensler has, in multiple interviews, repeatedly shared that he believes much of the industry already belongs under SEC jurisdiction, and its lawsuits are bringing the industry under compliance. Crypto firms argue that the recent legal battles haven't given the regulatory clarity the industry has been seeking for years.\nRepublican presidential nominee and former president Donald Trump, who has branded himself as the pro-crypto candidate for president, has pledged to \"fire\" Chair Gensler from his post, should he win in November.\nWhile the president does not have the power to fire appointed commissioners. Even if Trump were to appoint a new and more crypto-friendly SEC chairman, Gensler would remain a commissioner on the independent agency.\n\ntitle3:\nApple introduces AI-powered object removal in photos with the latest iOS update\ndescription3:\nApple released the new developer betas for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1 Sequoia. With this update, the company is launching new Apple Intelligence features, including the ability to remove objects from photos.\nThe feature, called Clean Up, lets users identify and remove an object from the photo without affecting the picture. The system uses AI to generate background when you remove an object from an image. Apple said that the system understands even shadow or reflection of an object and handles it while filling in the background.\nUsers can select an object using the smart detection feature to remove it with just one tap. People can also circle or brush over any unwanted objects to delete them from the image.\nApple\u2019s rival Google made a similar feature called Magic Eraser available to all Google Photos users for free earlier this year.\nIn July, Apple rolled out the first set of Apple Intelligence features with iOS 18.1 dev beta. These features included writing tools, notification summaries for SMS and Mail, natural language search and memory creation in Photos, transcription for calls and voice recordings in notes, and summaries and smart replies feature in Mail. Apple Intelligence is only available to users in English with their region set to the U.S.\n\ntitle4:\nTelegram CEO charged in French criminal investigation\ndescription4:\nA French investigative judge has charged Telegram CEO Pavel Durov with enabling illegal transactions among other alleged offenses, according to reports from NBC News and Le Monde. Durov had been arrested Saturday as part of an investigation into child sexual abuse material and other criminal activity on Telegram.\nFrench prosecutors will release Durov under judicial supervision on a \u20ac5 million bail, but he won\u2019t be allowed to leave France. As noted by Le Monde, Durov also faces charges of refusing to comply with authorities and complicity in the criminal distribution of CSAM.\nDurov was arrested as he deplaned in Paris on a warrant issued by France\u2019s OFMIN agency that\u2019s tasked with preventing violence against minors. An agency official cited Telegram\u2019s \u201clack of moderation and cooperation\u201d for the investigation. The judge ordered Durov to be released from police custody Wednesday morning prior to being brought to court for his \u201cfirst appearance and a possible indictment,\u201d according to a Paris prosecutor\u2019s office statement reported by The Associated Press.\nTelegram said in a statement on Sunday that Durov has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d and called the claim that the platform is responsible for its users\u2019 abuse of it \u201cabsurd.\u201d The platform serves as a major information source, particularly in countries like Russia, where unfiltered news can be otherwise hard to come by. But it\u2019s also widely known as a home base for terrorists and other bad actors.\"\n\nResponse:",
