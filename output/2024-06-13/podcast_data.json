Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday June 14), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla shareholder Elon Musk pay package at annual meeting\ndescription0:\nTesla shareholders on Thursday voted to ratify CEO Elon Musk's mammoth 2018 pay plan, five months after a judge in Delaware ordered the company to rescind the package, finding it had been improperly granted by the board.\nAt Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas, the vote in support of the compensation plan, doesn't override the court's ruling, but provides a public relations victory for Musk and could help his effort to sway a court to give him his performance options in the future.\nTaking the stage after the preliminary results were announced, Musk said, \"I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.\"\nWatch Elon Musk speak at the Tesla shareholder meeting now\nThe compensation package was previously worth as much as $56 billion in Tesla stock. In January, a Delaware court called the pay \"unfathomable.\" Judge Kathaleen McCormick found that Tesla's board members lacked independence from Musk, failed to properly negotiate at arm's length with the CEO and didn't to give shareholders the full picture before asking them to vote on his pay plan.\nTesla shares rose 2.9% in regular trading on Thursday to close at $182.47 after Musk posted on X that the proposal was set to be approved. The stock is still down 27% for the year, as Tesla reckons with declining sales tied to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China.\nThe annual meeting featured final votes on a dozen proxy proposals, including an effort by Musk to move Tesla's site of incorporation out of Delaware, where most large publicly traded companies are incorporated, and into Texas, home to the automaker's largest U.S. factory. Shareholders voted in favor of the move.\nAt the last shareholder meeting, in May 2023, Musk predicted the economy would pick up after 12 months, said that Tesla would deliver production Cybertrucks in late 2023, and informed investors that Tesla would \"try out a little advertising\" and see how it goes.\nRecent inflation and jobs numbers point to some improvement. Tesla held a Cybertruck deliveries event in late 2023, and has been advertising over the past year, including on X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that Musk acquired for $44 billion in late 2022.\nHowever, during last year's meeting, Musk promised shareholders he would spend less time on the app going forward, calling the business a \"short-term distraction.\"\nHe's still spending plenty of time on other things. Musk is CEO of SpaceX and brain computer interface company Neuralink. Last year he also started a new company called xAI, which has raised billions of dollars to developing large language models and an AI chatbot called Grok that uses data and data center capacity from X.\nAn exuberant Musk, calling himself \"pathologically optimistic,\" promised Tesla shareholders at the meeting that the company is making such great progress on developing \"vehicle autonomy,\" or systems to turn existing Tesla cars into self-driving vehicles, that he believes they can \"10x the value of the company.\"\nWhile Musk has been promising that level of autonomous technology since 2016, it's yet to deliver. Meanwhile, competitors including Pony.ai, Didi and Waymo have developed robotaxis and already operate commercial services.\nMusk described the company's ambition to create a ridehailing network populated with Tesla vehicles equipped with self-driving systems, though he didn't provide a timeline for development and rollout.\n\"There'll be some cars that Tesla owns itself.\" he said, \"But then for the fleet that is owned by our customers, it will be like an Airbnb thing. You can add or subtract your car to the fleet whenever you want.\"\nRegarding the Cybertruck, which hit the market in late 2023, Musk said deliveries are picking up. He said the company hit a weekly record of 1,300 shipments.\nMusk promised Tesla would move into \"limited production\" of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year. Next year, he predicted, the company will have \"over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla.\"\nWATCH: CNBC's full interview with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood\n\ntitle1:\nTesla shareholders sue Musk for starting competing AI company\ndescription1:\nTesla shareholders are suing CEO Elon Musk and members of the automaker\u2019s board of directors over Musk\u2019s decision to start xAI, which they say is a competing AI company, and then divert talent and resources from Tesla to the new startup.\nThe lawsuit is one of the most direct challenges to Musk\u2019s decision to start xAI, and it comes on the heels of his threat to develop AI outside of Tesla unless he is awarded more voting control over the company.\nThe suit was also filed just a few hours before Tesla is scheduled to host its annual meeting, where shareholders will likely vote to re-ratify the $56 billion compensation package that was struck down by a judge earlier this year.\nMusk has long claimed that Tesla\u2019s real value is that it\u2019s not just a maker of electric vehicles, but that it\u2019s actually an AI company. That claim is one reason why Tesla\u2019s stock is priced as high as that of a tech company, and more valuable than all four top automakers combined.\nThis new complaint was filed Thursday by Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund in Delaware Chancery Court, Daniel Hazen and Michael Giampietro on behalf of Tesla itself. In it, they allege that Musk and members of Tesla\u2019s board breached fiduciary duties to shareholders and unjustly enriched Musk by allowing the CEO to launch a competing company.\nThe plaintiffs in the case also say that Musk violated Tesla\u2019s code of business ethics by creating and leading xAI, and that the board has allowed Musk to continue to violate this code unimpeded. They are asking the court to force Musk to disgorge his stake in xAI and hand it over to Tesla.\n\u201cThe notion that the CEO of a major, publicly traded Delaware corporation could \u2014 with the evident approval of his board \u2014 start a competing company, and then divert talent and resources from his corporation to the startup, is preposterous,\u201d the complaint reads. It compares Musk\u2019s actions to a hypothetical situation involving the CEO of Coca-Cola starting a rival soft-drink company and sending ingredients to it.\nMusk launched xAI in 2023 and recently pulled in $6 billion in funding for the startup that aims to compete with rivals like OpenAI, Microsoft and Alphabet.\nThe plaintiffs note that, soon after, Tesla began diverting talent and resources from Tesla to xAI. The lawsuit says at least 11 employees have joined xAI directly from Tesla, and points to how Tesla has reportedly been providing xAI access to its AI-related data.\nThe plaintiffs also point to CNBC\u2019s reporting that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors from Nvidia that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk had posted on X a few weeks prior that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year \u201cin combined training and inference AI,\u201d and he\u2019s also said that Nvidia\u2019s pricey chips would be needed to help Tesla grow into a \u201cleader in AI & robotics.\u201d\nMusk admitted to diverting the chips to X, claiming that Tesla\u2019s new data center in Texas was still under construction and didn\u2019t have room to store them.\n\u201cThe Board has allowed Musk\u2014the CEO and largest stockholder of Tesla\u2014to found and lead another AI company; to plunder resources from Tesla and divert them to xAI; and to create billions in AI-related value at a company other than Tesla,\u201d the plaintiffs write. \u201cConsistent with its long history of obsequiousness to Musk, the Tesla Board has utterly failed to even attempt to meet its unyielding fiduciary duty to protect the interests of Tesla and its stockholders in the face of Musk\u2019s brazen disloyalty.\u201d\nEarlier this week, other Tesla shareholders filed a separate suit against Musk, claiming he made billions of dollars by selling the automaker\u2019s stock in 2021 and 2022 by using insider information.\n\ntitle2:\nFormer NSA head joins OpenAI board and safety committee\ndescription2:\nFormer head of the National Security Agency, retired Gen. Paul Nakasone, will join OpenAI\u2019s board of directors, the AI company announced Thursday afternoon. He will also sit on the board\u2019s \u201csecurity and safety\u201d subcommittee.\nThe high-profile addition is likely intended to satisfy critics who think that OpenAI is moving faster than is wise for its customers and possibly humanity, putting out models and services without adequately evaluating their risks or locking them down.\nNakasone brings decades of experience from the Army, U.S. Cyber Command and the NSA. Whatever one may feel about the practices and decision-making at these organizations, he certainly can\u2019t be accused of a lack of expertise.\nAs OpenAI increasingly establishes itself as an AI provider not just to the tech industry but government, defense and major enterprises, this kind of institutional knowledge is valuable both for itself and as a pacifier for worried shareholders. (No doubt the connections he brings in the state and military apparatus are also welcome.)\n\u201cOpenAI\u2019s dedication to its mission aligns closely with my own values and experience in public service,\u201d Nakasone said in a press release.\nThat certainly seems true: Nakasone and the NSA recently defended the practice of buying data of questionable provenance to feed its surveillance networks, arguing that there was no law against it. OpenAI, for its part, has simply taken, rather than buying, large swathes of data from the internet, arguing when it is caught that there is no law against it. They seem to be of one mind when it comes to asking forgiveness rather than permission, if indeed they ask either.\nThe OpenAI release also states:\nNakasone\u2019s insights will also contribute to OpenAI\u2019s efforts to better understand how AI can be used to strengthen cybersecurity by quickly detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats. We believe AI has the potential to deliver significant benefits in this area for many institutions frequently targeted by cyber attacks like hospitals, schools, and financial institutions.\nSo this is a new market play, as well.\nNakasone will join the board\u2019s safety and security committee, which is \u201cresponsible for making recommendations to the full Board on critical safety and security decisions for OpenAI projects and operations.\u201d What this newly created entity actually does and how it will operate is still unknown, as several of the senior people working on safety (as far as AI risk) have left the company, and the committee is itself in the middle of a 90-day evaluation of the company\u2019s processes and safeguards.\n\ntitle3:\nGPTZero\u2019s founders, still in their 20s, have a profitable AI detection startup, millions in the bank and a new $10M Series A\ndescription3:\nHere\u2019s how VC Nikhil Basu Trivedi beat out hoards of other VCs to win the deal\nAmong all the young AI startups being ruthlessly pursued by VCs these days, GPTZero has already grown into profitability in its first year and a half of life, generating millions in revenue. Founded by 24-year-old Edward Tian and 26-year-old Alex Cui, who\u2019ve been friends since high school, GPTZero offers a detection tool that helps identify whether a piece of content was AI generated.\nThe founders have chosen to take a $10 million \u201cpreemptive\u201d Series A led by Footwork co-founder Nikhil Basu Trivedi, the team has exclusively told TechCrunch. (\u201cPreemptive\u201d is VC-speak for when an investor nabs a deal before the founders were trying to raise.)\nThis is quite the coup for Basu Trivedi. GPTZero has been watched by top VC firms practically since Tian launched an initial version as a web app in December 2022, and 30,000 people instantly swarmed it, crashing its Streamlit-hosted website. (Adrien Treuille, Streamlit\u2019s co-founder, who sold to Snowflake for $800 million, later became an angel investor, Tian says.) The company formally launched in January 2023.\nThroughout 2024, as its customer base grew, the young founders fielded four to five calls from VCs per week, they said.\nGPTZero grew 500% in ARR in the last six months, the founders told TechCrunch, adding that its user base has grown from 1 million to 4 million in the last 12 months. This makes it one of the fast-growing consumer apps of the year, by some measures.\nThe company has been profitable for the last several months, they said, adding that they have more money in the bank than the total raised in the lifetime of the company. To put a number to that: more than $13 million between its $3.5 million seed and the new $10 million.\nAnd the growth continues. Users and revenue have \u201cmore than doubled, maybe even tripled, since January,\u201d Basu Trivedi said. While they didn\u2019t comment on valuation, based on a typical 20% Series A round, the deal has valued the company somewhere around the $50 million mark pre-money. Other investors in the round include education-focused (and women-led) Reach Capital; Jack Altman\u2019s Alt Capital; Uncork Capital (which led GPTZero\u2019s seed round); and Neo (Ali Partovi\u2019s fund).\nHow the VC won the deal\nBasu Trivedi, a Princeton alumni, won the lead on this deal by playing the long game. He met Tian in 2022, before GPTZero craziness, during an annual event where a small group of Princeton students visit Silicon Valley companies. Basu Trivedi always takes the group on a hike of the Stanford Dish.\nTian developed GPTZero while he was studying computer science, natural language processing and journalism at the Ivy League school. During internships for the BBC, and later at The New York Times, he wrote code that helped journalists identify AI-generated content.\nAfter the wild response his initial web app got, Tian reached out to his buddy, Cui, for help. Cui has a master\u2019s in machine learning from the University of Toronto and dropped out of his doctorate program to become a co-founder.\nThe two rewrote the app into its current standalone platform and raised the $3.5 million in seed after reaching about 1.5 million users in its first five months. This came mostly from angel investors like Tom Glocer, former CEO of Reuters; Russ Salakhutdinov, Carnegie Mellon University professor and ex-director of AI research at Apple (after he sold his startup, Perceptual Machines, to Apple in 2016); and Mark Thompson, CNN\u2019s CEO and former New York Times CEO.\nBasu Trivedi saw how GPTZero was gaining press and impressive angels \u2014 and heard the rumblings about it among the VC scuttlebutt. As a seed investor who backed companies like Canva, ClassDojo and Frame.io, he knew a hot company when he saw one.\nHe texted Tian in January 2023 to check in. He wooed the founders with his network and product know-how from his fast-growth companies like Canva, and with the background of his fund\u2019s co-founder, Mike Smith, former COO of Stitch Fix and Walmart.\nInvestors with both product and operations experience were what the two 20-something founders were \u201ccraving, especially as Alex and I are learning how to build a big company,\u201d Tian said.\nTo prove the point, shortly after they closed the round, Footwork organized a networking event with AI leaders, including Basu Trivedi\u2019s college classmate Jack Altman, who joined the A round and is brother to OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, and Nvidia founder CEO Jensen Huang\n\u201cA big data advantage\u201c\nGPTZero is far from the only company working to identify AI-generated content. Others include AI Writing Check, Copyleaks, GPT Radar, CatchGPT and Originality.ai.\nBut many in the AI-detection industry have abysmal accuracy, researchers find. So much so that OpenAI, which was pressured by AI-industry paranoia into launching its own AI detector at the start of 2023, shut the tool down about seven months later in July, after it was widely criticized for how poorly it worked.\nInterestingly, when TechCrunch\u2019s Kyle Wiggers did his own experiment with these tools, all of them flunked except GPTZero.\nNaturally, GPTZero has its own benchmarks, particularly through a partnership with Penn State researchers, that help it make its case that its tech works well, despite the industry\u2019s general reputation.\nCui says GPTZero is more accurate because it has access to more data and has built its own LLM models using the most advanced open source tools, which it won\u2019t disclose.\n\u201cWe have a big data advantage. We have millions of examples of text that is human versus AI,\u201d Cui said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also combined this with some of the best-in-class models and deep learning. We\u2019re actually using language models to detect language models.\u201d\nWhile the startup may be best known for helping teachers detect AI-generated student work (in October, GPTZero landed an agreement with the American Federation of Teachers), its customer base has expanded. It now includes government procurement agencies, grant-writing organizations, hiring managers, and \u2014 especially interesting \u2014 AI training data labelers.\nIt turns out, using AI-generated data for AI training \u201ccauses model collapse,\u201d Tian says, because teaching a model using fabricated examples isn\u2019t the best way to get it to function in the real world.\nNaturally, the young founders have a more grandiose long-term vision. They want to create a new, independent layer of the internet that performs accountability, ensuring that human and AI content is properly attributed.\nTo that end, the team is currently working on AI hallucination detection. Hallucinations, where the AI presents AI-generated fiction as if it were fact, are the bane of the GenAI industry. The company\u2019s first step toward addressing this is a newly available free AI text copyright check for LLM training datasets. This will help them generate the training data for broader hallucination detection.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to avoid a world where the entire internet is AI-generated content,\u201d Tian said. \u201cAn internet where everybody uses AI doesn\u2019t preserve the opportunity for people to continue contributing creative and original content.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nLinkedIn leans on AI to do the work of job hunting\ndescription4:\nThe zeitgeist in technology today is all about artificial intelligence, so in an effort to drive more users and usage, LinkedIn on Thursday took the wraps off a raft of new services powered by AI.\nThe company is betting big on AI and people\u2019s appetite to see it threaded through experiences on the platform, and is bringing tools that can do everything from helping people look for and then apply for jobs (yes, there\u2019s a tool to write the whole application and cover letter for you), to surfacing relevant learning material (about AI, naturally) and searching all of LinkedIn to find what you need more quickly.\nWe\u2019ll run through some of the bigger features that LinkedIn is rolling out, but first let\u2019s take a moment to note a couple of key things about LinkedIn\u2019s focus on AI right now.\nFirst, as we have pointed out before, this is not LinkedIn\u2019s first rodeo with AI. The company has been threading the tech into its products from its earliest days, and you could argue that there is very little that AI is not touching at the company.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building with AI since 2007,\u201d its head of product, Tomer Cohen, said in an interview with TechCrunch this week. Indeed, the company\u2019s connection suggestions, which have often felt very uncanny in what they surface, is one example of where that has played out. \u201cWe use it heavily for connecting people\u2026 for defense and how we keep trust in the ecosystem. It\u2019s one of our most powerful tools.\u201d\nThe big change that LinkedIn does not want to miss is the one that has swept the rest of the tech world: The wave of AI-powered tools aimed at helping ordinary people do human-centric tasks.\nLinkedIn has already been active in that sense. It launched a suite of OpenAI-powered tools in October 2023, adding reading and writing tools one month later, as well as tools to help with writing profiles, recruitment ads and company pages.\nSecond, LinkedIn has relatively lower expectations to meet than some of its peers. Big social players like Meta or X have found themselves facing different degrees of existential crises over the explosion of interest in generative AI. How will they respond to it? How will they lead it? Should they? Perhaps more directly, how do they make sure that the new-new-thing doesn\u2019t cut their businesses out of the next stage of growth?\nImage Credits: LinkedIn\nLinkedIn, of course, is a part of Microsoft, which has a 49% stake in OpenAI, alongside its own substantial AI efforts. Effectively, this takes the pressure of innovating or investing in innovators off LinkedIn itself, leaving it to concentrate on how it can build or integrate tools for its own uses.\nBelow is a run-down of some of the new features.\nJob searches and job applications. We\u2019re getting a new way to search for jobs using conversational prompts. It still relies on the data and the job actually existing, of course. For example, finding jobs in journalism in London that pay a salary of at least \u00a3100,000 may not turn up much, no matter how many ways you phrase it.\nOnce you have found jobs and want to apply, you can now generate a cover letter or a letter of introduction, and the AI will also give you a further review of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and other work you\u2019re doing.\nLearning personalisation. LinkedIn continues to be bullish on its video-based learning platform, and it appears to have found a strong current among users who need to skill up in AI. Cohen said that traffic for AI-related courses \u2014 which include modules on technical skills as well as non-technical ones such as basic introductions to generative AI \u2014 has increased by 160% over last year.\nYou can be sure that LinkedIn is pushing its search algorithms to tap into the interest, but it\u2019s also boosting its content with AI in another way.\nFor Premium subscribers, it is piloting what it describes as \u201cexpert advice, powered by AI.\u201d Tapping into expertise from well-known instructors such as Alicia Reece, Anil Gupta, Dr. Gemma Leigh Roberts and Lisa Gates, LinkedIn says its AI-powered coaches will deliver responses personalized to users, as a \u201cstarting point.\u201d\nThese will, in turn, also appear as personalized coaches that a user can tap while watching a LinkedIn Learning course.\nThe third big area LinkedIn is leaning heavily on AI is search. If you already use LinkedIn in any way, you\u2019ll know that this is very long overdue, as search has been one of the most neglected parts of the experience on the platform, especially as the platform has grown.\nLinkedIn says it will provide more detail on the new search experience in the coming weeks, but expect to see a lot more conversational search as a simpler alternative or replacement for its current search experience, which uses keywords, network distance, geography and other parameters but never feels like it\u2019s giving you the complete answer.\nAlongside all this, LinkedIn is expanding availability of Recruiter 2024, adding more tools for marketers, and introducing enhanced, premium company pages for small businesses.\"\n\nResponse:",
