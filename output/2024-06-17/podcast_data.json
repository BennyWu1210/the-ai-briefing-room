Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday June 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nUS sues Adobe for hiding termination fees and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions\ndescription0:\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Adobe alleging that the company deceives consumers by hiding the early-termination fee and making it difficult for people to cancel their subscriptions.\nIn the complaint filed on Monday, the DOJ wrote that \u201cAdobe has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.\u201d\nThe government says Adobe pushed consumers toward the \u201cannual paid monthly\u201d subscription without informing them that canceling the plan in the first year would cost hundreds of dollars.\nAdobe only discloses the early-termination fees when subscribers attempt to cancel, and turns the early-termination fee into a \u201cpowerful retention tool\u201d by trapping consumers in subscriptions that they no longer want, the complaint says.\n\u201cDuring enrollment, Adobe hides material terms of its APM plan in fine print and behind option textboxes and hyperlinks, proving disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that most consumers never see,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cAdobe then deters cancellations by employing an onerous and complicated cancellation process.\u201d\nAdobe says it plans to refute the claims in court.\n\u201cSubscription services are convenient, flexible and cost effective to allow users to choose the plan that best fits their needs, timeline and budget,\u201d said Adobe\u2019s General Counsel and Chief Trust Officer Dana Rao, in a statement. \u201cOur priority is to always ensure our customers have a positive experience. We are transparent with the terms and conditions of our subscription agreements and have a simple cancellation process.\u201d\nThe DOJ\u2019s complaint says Adobe has violated federal laws designed to protect consumers. The government is seeking \u201cinjunctive relief, civil penalties, equitable monetary relief, as well as other relief.\u201d\nAdobe shifted to a subscription model in 2012 and started requiring consumers to pay for access to the company\u2019s software on a recurring basis. In the past, users could access the company\u2019s software after paying a one-time fee.\nSubscriptions account for most of the company\u2019s revenue, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which launched a similar lawsuit against Amazon last year, saying it \u201cknowingly\u201d complicates the ability of customers of its Prime service to cancel their subscriptions.\n\ntitle1:\nTikTok ads will now include AI avatars of creators and stock actors\ndescription1:\nTikTok announced on Monday that it\u2019s introducing generative AI avatars of creators and stock actors for branded content and ads on its platform. The company is also launching an \u201cAI Dubbing\u201d tool for creators and brands to expand the reach of their ads and branded content.\nThe new \u201cCustom Avatars\u201d are designed to represent a creator or a brand spokesperson. Creators can choose to scale their likeness to create multilingual avatars to expand their global reach and brand collaborations, TikTok says. Brands can create avatars with their spokesperson or a creator they have partnered with to localize their global campaigns.\nThere are also new \u201cStock Avatars,\u201d which are pre-built avatars created using paid actors who are licensed for commercial use. The idea behind these avatars is to give businesses a way to add a human touch to their content. TikTok says the avatars are created with actors from a range of backgrounds, nationalities and languages.\nImage Credits: TikTok\nThe launch of the new tools might be concerning for some. Hollywood actors went on strike last year over several different concerns about AI, including the fear that their likenesses would be used to generate AI replicas. With TikTok\u2019s new AI avatars, creators have control over whether they want their likeness used. Creators can also determine their rates, licensing and who can use their avatar.\nAs for the new AI Dubbing tool, it will allow creators and brands to translate their content into 10 languages, including English, Japanese, Korean and Spanish. It automatically detects the language in a video, and then transcribes and translates the content to produce a dubbed video in the preferred language. TikTok says the new feature lets creators and brands communicate with global audiences.\nThe launch comes as TikTok recently revealed that 61% of users have made a purchase either directly on TikTok or after seeing an ad.\nThe new features will be available as part of \u201cTikTok Symphony,\u201d the company\u2019s suite of ads solutions powered by generative AI, which was launched in May. The suite includes tools to help marketers write scripts, produce videos and enhance current assets.\nTikTok is building out its ads business despite facing a potential ban in the U.S. if its parent company, ByteDance, fails to sell the app within a year.\n\ntitle2:\nApple stops offering buy now, pay later loans in U.S.\ndescription2:\nApple said on Monday that it has stopped issuing loans through Apple Pay Later, its buy-now-pay-later program that launched last year.\nThe move comes after Apple said it would start allowing installment loans later this year in its Apple Pay checkout process through third-party companies, such as Affirm , and credit and debit cards from issuers, such as Citigroup.\nApple said it would no longer issue Apple Pay Later loans, which enabled customers to buy products online and pay in four interest-free installments, at prices up to $1,000. The discontinuation is a sign that not every new fintech feature or product that Apple launches becomes a success or fits in with the iPhone maker's overall strategy.\n\"Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay,\" an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. \"With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.\"\nApple said users who wanted installment plans at checkout would gain access to them through other financial intermediaries in more countries around the world than they would with Apple Pay Later, which was only available in the U.S.\nApple said its priority with Apple Pay, the brand name for its contactless and online payment software, was to enable secure and private payments. Users with open loans will continue to have access to Apple Pay Later features to manage and pay their loans, Apple said.\nBefore it was discontinued, Apple Pay Later enabled users to apply for loans within the iPhone Wallet app, and approved users would see a \"Pay Later\" option when checking out online.\nThe process notably involved Apple taking over more of the financial backend than some of its other products, like Apple Card. For the program, Apple made some of its own credit credit checks and loan decisions, instead of having those handled entirely through financial partners. Apple's loans were issued by a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\ntitle3:\nMicrosoft shakes up Xbox marketing as key exec departs for Roblox\ndescription3:\nI have some news to share with all of you: Jerret West, who has served as the Chief Marketing Officer of Xbox for four and a half years, will be leaving Microsoft to join Roblox as their new CMO and Head of Market Expansion. His last day will be June 30th.\nOn behalf of Team Xbox, I\u2019d like to thank Jerret for everything he accomplished. During his time here, Jerret was instrumental in launching and growing communities like our Xbox social universe to 120M followers strong, and product expansion like Game Pass which is now available in more than 80 countries worldwide. He oversaw the creation and delivery of global marketing campaigns for numerous games, platforms (console, PC, cloud) and brand moments such as this year\u2019s momentous Xbox Games Showcase. Roblox is an important partner for Xbox, and we look forward to working with Jerret and the Roblox team to connect more people around the world through the power of play.\nAs a team we are committed to growing the strong marketing capability in Gaming. Going forward, the Gaming Leadership Team and I have decided to place marketing closer to the businesses they support. Games marketing will sit inside of Studios, Xbox marketing will sit inside the Xbox team, international marketing will sit inside of the Consumer Sales Org, and our centralized marketing team will report to me. The following organizational changes will be effective on July 1st:\nThe Integrated Marketing team led by Kirsten Ward and the Programming and Events team led by Tina Summerford will come together as an expanded Central Gaming Marketing team under Kirsten, who will report to me as a member of the Gaming Executive Leadership Team. Chief of staff Pav Bhardwaj and executive assistant Kim Nold will report to Kirsten.\nThe Bethesda Publishing Marketing team, led by Erin Losi, will move to Game Content and Studios, reporting to Matt Booty.\nThe 1P Games Marketing Team including Xbox Game Studios and Mojang, led by Aaron Greenberg, will also move to Game Content and Studios, reporting to Matt.\nThe Xbox Marketing team, led by Chris Lee, will move to the Xbox Org, reporting to Sarah Bond.\nThe International Marketing team, led by Jim McMullin and Florian Liewer, will move to the Consumer Sales Org, reporting to Ami Silverman.\nThe Bethesda International Marketing team, led by Adam Carter, will also move to the Consumer Sales Org. Adam will be taking on a new role leading Business Operations at Bethesda, reporting to Jill Braff. The Consumer Sales Org will work on backfilling his role and share more at a later date.\nWe\u2019re fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and experience, and I\u2019m excited to see how our marketing will evolve under their leadership.\nPhil\n\ntitle4:\nStarboard has Autodesk stake, weighs suit over probe disclosure\ndescription4:\nStarboard Value, the activist fund run by Jeff Smith, has taken a sizable stake in graphics design firm Autodesk and has spoken with the company's board in recent weeks over several serious concerns involving its disclosures around an internal investigation that led to the ouster of its chief financial officer.\nStarboard's stake is valued at roughly $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter. The activist, which has a long track record of investing in the technology sector, is particularly concerned about the timing of Autodesk's disclosure of an internal investigation. That investigation revealed that executives misled investors about the company's free cash flow metrics and operating margins, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential information freely.\nAfter the probe results came out, Autodesk's then-CFO Deborah Clifford was ousted from her role and moved to a different executive role within Autodesk. The probe found that executives manipulated reporting tied to the company's contract billing structure, as Autodesk shifted back to upfront payments from annualized payments, to improve those metrics.\nAutodesk first disclosed in April that it had begun an internal investigation into disclosure issues around those metrics, almost a month after first beginning the investigation and informing the Securities and Exchange Commission about the probe into its financial reports. Autodesk shares slid 20% over the next few weeks. The company's market cap now sits slightly below $50 billion.\nThe delayed disclosure came a little more than a week after the deadline to nominate directors closed. The tight window and timing of the disclosure raised significant concerns inside Starboard, the people said, that Autodesk's board deliberately chose not to inform shareholders ahead of its annual meeting. Such a delay would potentially limit a shareholder's ability to nominate its own candidates in a contested fight.\nStarboard is weighing legal action in the Delaware Court of Chancery to compel the reopening of Autodesk's nominating window and the delay of Autodesk's annual meeting, the people said. Autodesk's shareholder meeting is currently scheduled for July 16.\nThe activist also believes that the company can drive actual margin improvement and improve investor communications to help bolster Autodesk's stock, the people said.\nStarboard has built stakes in other major technology companies, including Marc Benioff's Salesforce and Splunk, which was sold to Cisco in 2023 for $28 billion.\nNews of Starboard's stake and plans was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\nAutodesk has faced activist scrutiny before. In 2016, it settled with two activist investors at Sachem Head Capital Management and Eminence Capital to stave off a proxy contest.\nAutodesk disclosed earlier this year that it is facing probes from the Justice Department and SEC.\nAn Autodesk spokesperson said the company welcomed \"constructive input\" from shareholders.\n\"We are confident in our strategic direction, significant margin opportunity, and our corporate governance,\" the spokesperson said.\"\n\nResponse:",
