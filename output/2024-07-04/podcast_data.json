STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images\nBitcoin's price slumped to around $57,000 apiece Thursday, hitting a two-month low after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes from its June meeting indicating the central bank isn't yet ready to cut interest rates. At around 2:30 p.m. London time, the digital currency fell around 5% in 24 hours to $56,837, falling below the $57,000 mark for the first time since May 1, according to data from crypto ranking site CoinGecko. Since then, bitcoin has pared losses somewhat and was trading at $57,932.57, down 3.4% as of 5:05 p.m. London time. Rival token ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, was down 5% at $3,120.\nIt comes after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday released minutes from its June meeting which showed officials are reluctant to lower interest rates until additional data shows inflation moving sustainably toward the central bank's 2% target. Higher interest rates are typically less favorable for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it dampens investor risk appetite. Bitcoin stormed to an all-time high of above $73,700 in March this year after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.\nETFs allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Crypto proponents say this has helped legitimize the asset class and make it easier for larger institutional investors to get involved. Since then, however, bitcoin has been trading within a range between roughly $59,000 and $72,000. Recently, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been pressured by news of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox readying the distribution of around $9 billion worth of coins to users, which is expected to lead to some significant selling action.\nwatch now\nOn Thursday, a small amount of bitcoin was moved from three wallets previously associated with Mt. Gox, according to Arkham Intelligence. The largest movement was for $24 worth of the cryptocurrency. It was not immediately clear if this transaction was made in connection with the Mt. Gox repayment plan. Elsewhere, the German government on Thursday sold roughly 3,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth approximately $175 million as of today's prices \u2014 from a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k, according to blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence . Arkham, which is tracking the German government's bitcoin wallet, said that the assets were moved to crypto exchanges Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, as well as an separate, unidentified wallet. \"These funds are likely moving to a deposit for an institutional service or OTC,\" Arkham said in a post on X.\nCan bitcoin still gain from here?\nHowever, analysts at crypto data and research firm CCData said in a research report Tuesday that bitcoin hasn't yet reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to hit a fresh all-time high. According to the report, historical market \"cycles\" have shown that bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event \u2014 which cuts the supply of new bitcoins to the market \u2014 has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last between 12 to 18 months \u201cbefore producing a cycle top.\u201d\nwatch now\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft\u2019s Midnight Blizzard breach also impacted federal agencies\ndescription1:\nIn March, Microsoft notified the US Department of Veterans Affairs that it was impacted by the security breach that enabled the Russian hacking group known as \u201cMidnight Blizzard\u201d to steal some of the company\u2019s source code, reports Bloomberg. Already assigned blame for the earlier SolarWinds attack, the group has been accused of spying on email accounts of Microsoft\u2019s senior leadership team and attempting to use the secrets obtained there to create additional security breaches.\nThe VA department found that Midnight Blizzard used a single set of stolen credentials to access a Microsoft Cloud test environment around January. VA officials told Bloomberg that the account was accessed for just one second, presumably to see if the credentials worked \u2014 they have since been updated.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Microsoft also informed the US Agency for Global Media that some of its data may have been stolen. Security data and sensitive, personally identifiable information held by the agency is not believed to have been compromised. The Peace Corps was also notified of the Midnight Blizzard breach but told Bloomberg that it was able to \u201cmitigate the vulnerability.\u201d Microsoft hasn\u2019t disclosed which customers have been impacted by the attack.\n\u201cAs our investigation continues, we have been reaching out to customers to notify them if they had corresponded with a Microsoft corporate email account that was accessed,\u201d Microsoft spokesperson Jeff Jones said to The Verge. \u201cWe will continue to coordinate, support, and assist our customers in taking mitigating measures.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nTesla short sellers lost $3.5 billion in two days after Q2 deliveries\ndescription2:\nAn electric vehicle of the model Y is pictured during the start of the production at Tesla's \"Gigafactory\" on March 22, 2022 in Gruenheide, southeast of Berlin. - US electric car pioneer Tesla received the go-ahead for its \"gigafactory\" in Germany on March 4, 2022, paving the way for production to begin shortly after an approval process dogged by delays and setbacks. (Photo by Patrick Pleul / POOL / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\nTesla's better-than-expected deliveries report this week has been bad news for traders betting on a drop in the electric vehicle maker's stock.\nWith the shares rallying 17% in the two trading days since the second-quarter report, short sellers have lost an estimated $3.5 billion on a mark-to-market basis, according to data from S3 Partners.\nIt's been a painful few months for short sellers, as Tesla shares have soared 73% since bottoming for the year in April. After closing at $246.39 in shortened trading on Wednesday, the stock is a little more than $2 shy of wiping out its loss for the year.\nShort interest in Tesla currently stands at 3.5% of float, or 97 million shares shorted, with a $22.4 billion notional value.\nTesla reported second-quarter deliveries on Tuesday of 443,956, topping Wall Street estimates of 439,000. Deliveries fell 4.8% from a year earlier, but the decline wasn't as steep as the 8.5% year-over-year drop in the first quarter.\nWhile the deliveries report suggested demand for Tesla vehicles remains stronger than feared, it offered a limited view into company performance.\nWith its autos business mired in a sales decline due to an aging lineup, and stronger competition than ever, Tesla has for months been incentivizing EV purchases with discounts, low- or no-interest financing options and other perks.\nIn the second quarter, for example, Tesla slashed prices in Germany and Norway and offered zero-interest loan promos in China, even for its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUVs. In the U.S., Tesla offered a three-year, 2% APR financing deal for buyers of its rear-wheel drive Model 3.\nMeanwhile, Tesla's newest model, the angular steel Cybertruck, has gotten off to a slow start, with quality problems necessitating four voluntary recalls in the U.S. in less than a year.\n\ntitle3:\nChina leads the generative AI patents race; Tencent, Baidu top list: UN\ndescription3:\nTIANJIN, CHINA - JUNE 20: A humanoid robot Xiao Qi is on display during the 2024 World Intelligence Expo at the National Convention and Exhibition Center (Tianjin) on June 20, 2024 in Tianjin, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)\nChina dominates the global race in generative artificial intelligence patents, filing more than 38,000 patents from 2014 to 2023, a new United Nations report on Thursday showed.\nThat's six times more than those filed by U.S.-based inventors, the UN World Intellectual Property Organization said.\nGenerative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that allows users to generate content such as text, images, music, audio, and videos.\nGeographically, China leads with 38,210 inventions, far surpassing the U.S. (6,276), Republic of Korea (4,155), Japan (3,409) and India (1,350).\nGenerative AI patents currently make up 6% of total AI patents in the world, according to the report.\n\"The sharp rise in patenting activity reflects the recent technological advances and the potential within GenAI,\" the report said.\n\ntitle4:\nForestay, Europe's newest $220M growth-stage VC fund, will focus on AI\ndescription4:\nForestay, an emerging VC based out of Geneva, Switzerland, has been busy. This week it closed its second fund, Forestay Capital II, at a hard cap of $220 million. The VC wasn\u2019t well known in Europe until it started to lead rounds in enterprise startups a couple of years ago, notably scanning software startup Scandit \u2014 which has raised $273 million to date \u2014 out of Zurich.\nThe Forestay II fund will invest across Europe and Israel, with a \u201csweet spot\u201d of leading growth rounds of $10 million to $15 million, at the inflection point of a company, it said.\nTo date, the VC has backed 13 companies, including K2view, Nexthink, Scandit and Wasabi; three of these have reached unicorn status and two were acquired. Most recently, the firm backed Neural Concept, a company spun out from EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, which raised $27 million in a Series B round to tackle fast manufacturing design with AI.\nForestay also led the Series A round for Portugal\u2019s \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d startup Stratio with a $12 million Series A back in 2021.\nThe Forestay fund was founded as a fund of B-Flexion, the private investment vehicle created by the Bertarelli family that is best known for building Serono into the third-largest biotech business globally, before its merger with Merck KGaA.\nForestay is led by Frederic Wohlwend, the former Global Chief Digital Officer of Merck KGaA and Serono.\n\u201cAs Chief Digital Officer in large corporations, mainly the biopharma clinical space, I had the chance to look at the entire value chain, from early research down to distribution, in fairly sizable enterprises,\u201d he told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cSo by knowing the enterprise inside out, that\u2019s why we decided to focus on enterprise and enterprise AI.\u201d\nWhile \u201cit\u2019s a highly competitive market,\u201d Wohlwend said the fund will be \u201cextremely focused in the way we do venture, adding: \u201cWe only do enterprise AI and SaaS. We don\u2019t do any hardware, even sensors and stuff like this. We\u2019re super focused in terms of stage \u2014 we mainly play in Series B. We can do A to C rounds, but our sweet spot is Series B at the inflection point. So we brand ourselves as a \u2018nearly growth\u2019 fund because we capture our targets as soon as they make some kind of revenue.\u201d\nHe added that, besides Switzerland being \u201can interesting ecosystem,\u201d Southern Europe is also coming up, as we recently reported.\nForestay\u2019s new fund is also backed by Ana\u00efs Ventures, the investment vehicle for certain members of the Firmenich family, which created a perfume empire.\nIn a statement, Julien Firmenich said: \u201cForestay\u2019s focused investment strategy and operational acumen, honed through years of industry experience, align perfectly with our vision.\u201d\nGiven its consumer markets are so fragmented by geography and language, Europe has carved out a very good market for SaaS and enterprise, and there are plenty of enterprise-focused VCs.\nIndeed, an in-depth analysis of the top companies and trends in the SaaS market across Europe and Israel last year found the SaaS ecosystem market reset was being driven by the growth in generative AI. But Forestay\u2019s emergence can only be a good thing, adding to the choice of funds for growth-stage startups in Europe, where growth capital is often harder to acquire than in the U.S.\"\n\nResponse:",
