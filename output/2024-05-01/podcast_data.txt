UnitedHealth CEO says company paid hackers $22 million ransom
description0:
UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill on May 1, 2024 in Washington, DC.
UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty confirmed for the first time that the company paid a $22 million ransom to hackers who breached its subsidiary Change Healthcare and caused widespread fallout across the health-care sector. Witty's comments were made during a Wednesday hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.
Change Healthcare provides payment, revenue management and other solutions like e-prescription software. The company disconnected affected systems when the threat was detected, leaving many doctors temporarily unable to fill prescriptions or get paid for their services.
UnitedHealth told CNBC in April that it paid a ransom to try and protect patient data. Earlier reports had discovered a $22 million transfer on Bitcoin's blockchain, but the company had not confirmed the figure until now.
"The decision to pay a ransom was mine," Witty said. "This was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone."
UnitedHealth is one of the largest companies in the world, with a roughly $450 billion market cap. Its business unit Optum — which provides care to 103 million customers — and Change Healthcare — which touches one in three patient records — merged in 2022.
Committee Chairman Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in his opening remarks that the Change Healthcare breach serves as a "dire warning about the consequences of too-big-to-fail mega-corporations."
"Companies that are so big have an obligation to protect their customers and to lead on this issue," Wyden said.
Witty told the committee that cybercriminals accessed Change Healthcare through a server that was not protected by multi-factor authentication, or MFA, which requires users to verify their identity in at least two different ways. He said UnitedHealth now has MFA in place across all external-facing systems.
"As a result of this malicious cyberattack, patients and providers have experienced disruptions and people are worried about their private health data," Witty said. "To all those impacted, let me be very clear: I am deeply, deeply sorry."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., held up a bright yellow copy of "Hacking for Dummies" during the hearing, saying the breach is UnitedHealth's responsibility to fix.
"This is some basic stuff that was missed, so shame on internal audit, external audit and your systems folks tasked with redundancy, they're not doing their job," Tillis said.
A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that UnitedHealth discovered that a cyber threat actor accessed part of Change Healthcare's information technology network in late February.
Witty said Change Healthcare's core systems are back online, though some of its secondary support functions are still being restored.
UnitedHealth said in February that the ransomware group Blackcat was behind the attack. Blackcat, which also goes by the names Noberus and ALPHV, steals sensitive data from institutions and threatens to publish it unless a ransom is paid, according to a December release from the U.S. Department of Justice.
UnitedHealth confirmed in April that files containing protected health information and personally identifiable information were compromised in the breach. The company said a data review is ongoing, so it could be months before the company can notify affected individuals.
Witty said Wednesday that UnitedHealth is working with regulators to assess the breach and to inform people if their information has been compromised "as soon as possible."
Early in March, UnitedHealth launched a temporary funding assistance program to help support providers that have experienced cash flow disruptions due to the cyberattack. There are no fees, interest or other costs on top of the payments, and providers have 45 days to repay the funds once their standard payment operations resume.
During the hearing, Witty said the company has not yet asked anyone for loan repayments, and it will be up to providers to determine when their operations have officially returned to normal.
Witty did not directly disclose whether UnitedHealth will provide additional support to providers who may be contending with other loans and interest payments because of the breach.
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., pressed Witty to share how UnitedHealth is working to ensure something like the Change Healthcare breach will not happen again. Witty said the company plans to share what it discovers about the breach with others, adding that there's a need to focus on reducing the rate of cyberattacks on the health-care sector.
"We are clearly trying to take our responsibility in this attack. We are also trying to learn from it," he said.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy broke federal labor law with anti-union remarks
description1:
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy violated federal labor law in comments he made to media outlets about unionization efforts at the company, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled Wednesday.
NLRB Administrative Law Judge Brian Gee cited interviews Jassy gave in 2022 to CNBC's "Squawk Box," Bloomberg Television and at The New York Times' DealBook conference. The interviews coincided with an upswing in union campaigns in Amazon's warehouse and delivery operations.
Jassy told CNBC in April 2022 that if employees were to vote in a union, they may be less empowered in the workplace and things would become "much slower" and "more bureaucratic." Similarly, in the Bloomberg interview, Jassy remarked, "if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, 'Let's change it.'"
At the DealBook conference, Jassy said that without a union the workplace isn't "bureaucratic, it's not slow."
Gee said the comments "threatened employees that, if they selected a union, they would become less empowered and would find it harder to get things done quickly."
The NLRB filed the complaint against Amazon and Jassy in October 2022. In his ruling Wednesday, Gee said Jassy's other comments that unionization would change workers' relationship with their employer were lawful. But the Amazon chief's other remarks that employees would be less empowered and "better off" without a union violated labor law, "because they went beyond merely commenting on the employee-employer relationship."
Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in a statement that the company disagrees with the NLRB's ruling and that it intends to appeal.
"The decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard," Paradis said.
The judge recommends Amazon be ordered to "cease and desist" from making such comments in the future, and that the company be required to post and distribute a notice about the order to employees nationwide.

title2:
One-third of Americans could be hit by Change Healthcare cyberattack
description2:
UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty on Wednesday told lawmakers that data from an estimated one-third of Americans could have been compromised in the cyberattack on its subsidiary Change Healthcare, and that the company paid a $22 million ransom to hackers.
Witty testified in front of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which falls under the House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce. He said the investigation into the breach is still ongoing, so the exact number of people affected remains unknown. The one-third figure is a rough estimate.
UnitedHealth has previously said the cyberattack likely impacts a "substantial proportion of people in America," according to an April release. The company confirmed that files containing protected health information and personally identifiable information were compromised in the breach.
It will likely be months before UnitedHealth is able to notify individuals, given the "complexity of the data review," the release said. The company is offering free access to identity theft protection and credit monitoring for individuals concerned about their data.
Witty also testified in front of the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance on Wednesday, when he confirmed for the first time that the company paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers that breached Change Healthcare. At the hearing before the House legislators later that afternoon, Witty said the payment was made in bitcoin.
UnitedHealth disclosed that a cyberthreat actor breached part of Change Healthcare's information technology network late in February. The company disconnected the affected systems when the threat was detected, and the disruption has caused widespread fallout across the U.S. health-care sector.
Witty told the subcommittee in his written testimony that the cyberattackers used "compromised credentials" to infiltrate Change Healthcare's systems on Feb. 12 and deployed a ransomware that encrypted the network nine days later.
The portal that the bad actors initially accessed was not protected by multifactor authentication, or MFA, which requires users to verify their identities in at least two different ways.
Witty told both committees Wednesday that UnitedHealth now has MFA in place across all external-facing systems.

Google cuts hundreds of 'Core' workers, moves jobs to India, Mexico
description3:
Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during Stanford's 2024 Business, Government, and Society forum in Stanford, California, US, on Wednesday, April 3, 2024.
Just ahead of its blowout first-quarter earnings report on April 25, Google laid off at least 200 employees from its "Core" teams, in a reorganization that will include moving some roles to India and Mexico, CNBC has learned.
The Core unit is responsible for building the technical foundation behind the company's flagship products and for protecting users' online safety, according to Google's website. Core teams include key technical units from information technology, its Python developer team, technical infrastructure, security foundation, app platforms, core developers, and various engineering roles.
At least 50 of the positions eliminated were in engineering at the company's offices in Sunnyvale, California, filings show. Many Core teams will hire corresponding roles in Mexico and India, according to internal documents viewed by CNBC.
Asim Husain, vice president of Google Developer Ecosystem, announced news of the layoffs to his team in an email last week. He also spoke at a town hall and told employees that this was the biggest planned reduction for his team this year, an internal document shows.
"We intend to maintain our current global footprint while also expanding in high-growth global workforce locations so that we can operate closer to our partners and developer communities," Husain wrote in the email.
Alphabet has been slashing headcount since early last year, when the company announced plans to eliminate about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, following a downturn in the online ad market. Even with digital advertising rebounding recently, Alphabet has continued downsizing, with layoffs across multiple organizations this year.
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat announced in mid-April that the company's finance department would undergo restructuring, entailing layoffs and moving positions to Bangalore and Mexico City. The company's search boss, Prabhakar Raghavan, told employees at an all-hands meeting in March that Google plans to build teams closer to users in key markets, including India and Brazil, where labor is cheaper than in the U.S.
The latest cuts come as the company enjoys its fastest growth rate since early 2022, alongside improving profit margins. Last week, Alphabet reported a 15% jump in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier and announced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion buyback.

Qualcomm earnings report fiscal Q2 2024
description4:
Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon responds to a question during a keynote conversation at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 10, 2024.
Qualcomm reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that surpassed Wall Street expectations, and provided a strong guide for the current quarter.
Shares rose about 4% in extended trading.
Here's how it did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended March 24:
Earnings per share : $2.44 adjusted vs. $2.32 expected
: $2.44 adjusted vs. $2.32 expected Revenue: $9.39 billion adjusted vs. $9.34 billion expected
Net income during the quarter was $2.33 billion, or $2.06 per share, versus $1.7 billion, or $1.52 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Qualcomm said it expected between $8.8 billion and $9.6 billion in sales in the current quarter, higher than Wall Street expectations of $9.05 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.17 per share, versus the company's forecast of between $2.15 and $2.35.
The company said on the earnings call that it expected overall handset revenues to decline during the current quarter by "mid-single digit percent" because of a lack of summer smartphone launches, which is a typical seasonal pattern.
Qualcomm's most important business is its handsets business. It sells processors, modems and other parts for smartphones — primarily Android devices, but also some modem parts in iPhones.
Handset sales rose 1% year over year to $6.18 billion, signaling that the smartphone market may be recovering after a few years of post-Covid slumping. Qualcomm called out strong demand for "premium tier" smartphones that require the most advanced chips, especially in China. It said quarterly revenue from Chinese phone makers jumped 40% from the year-earlier period.
"We have not seen signs of weakness in the Android premium market in China," Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on an earnings call with analysts. "A lot of the strength is really coming from premium devices on Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo."
Qualcomm calls the phones that use its best chips "AI-powered smartphones," citing features such as generative email completion, live translation, and virtual assistants that use the chips specialized "NPU" AI section. One such phone is Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra, which launched earlier this year.
"We are seeing the very first instances of on-device AI and Gen AI being launched in premium devices and that is resonating well with the consumer," Amon said, adding that the company is targeting performance per watt as its primary artificial intelligence benchmark.
The company's automotive business, which sells chips to automakers, also showed signs of growth, rising 35% year over year to $603 million. Qualcomm said it expected consecutive double digit percentage growth in the division in the current quarter. Revenue in the "Internet of Things" business — lower-cost chips and chips for virtual reality — declined 11% year over year to $1.24 billion.
Those three business lines are reported together as QCT, the company's chip business, which saw a 1% year-over-year sales increase to $8.03 billion.
The company's licensing business, QTL, in which it collects fees from companies that want to integrate 5G or cellular technology into their products, increased 2% to $1.32 billion from the year-earlier period.
Qualcomm said it paid $895 million in dividends and repurchased $731 million in shares during the quarter, and raised its quarterly dividend to 85 cents from 80 cents previously."

我是wall-e，这是您周三5月1日的ai简讯。联合健康集团（unitedhealth group）首席执行官安德鲁·维蒂（andrew witty）在5月1日，2024年华盛顿特区参加美国参议院财政委员会听证会时证实，该公司为了应对其子公司change healthcare遭受的黑客攻击，支付了2200万美元的赎金。维蒂的这番话是他第一次公开确认支付赎金的金额。change healthcare提供支付、收益管理以及电子处方软件等解决方案。在检测到威胁后，公司切断了受影响系统的连接，导致许多医生暂时无法开具处方或获得付款。
