Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The case stems back to 2016 when the European Commission ordered Ireland to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple.\nThe European Court of Justice's decision comes hours after the company unveiled new products to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod lineups.\nApple shares were down about 1%.\nIn a statement, the Irish government said that the Apple case \"involved an issue that is now of historical relevance only,\" adding that its position has always been that it \"does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers.\"\nApple said in a filing on Tuesday that it will incur a one-time income tax charge of about $10 billion in its fourth fiscal quarter ending Sept. 28, 2024.\nThe government noted it will now begin the process of transferring the assets in the escrow fund to Ireland.\n\"This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to. We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal,\" an Apple spokesperson said. \"The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the US.\"\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle's 2.4 billion euro fine upheld by Europe's top court\ndescription1:\nThe European Union flag is seen with Google's logo.\nThe commission said at the time that Google had favored its own shopping comparison service over those of its rivals.\nThe fine stems from an antitrust investigation by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, which concluded in 2017.\nCNBC has reached out to Google for comment.\nEurope's top court on Tuesday upheld a 2.4 billion euro ($2.65 billion) fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service.\nGoogle appealed the decision with the General Court, the EU's second-highest court, which also upheld the fine. Google then brought the case before the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court.\nThe ECJ on Tuesday dismissed the appeal and upheld the commission's fine.\n\"We are disappointed with the decision of the Court,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\"This judgment relates to a very specific set of facts. We made changes back in 2017 to comply with the European Commission's decision. Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services.\"\nTo address European concerns, Google in 2017 made changes that meant it will have to bid in the same way as competitors for advertising slots within shopping search results.\nThe Google decision caps off another major case for the EU after the ECJ on Tuesday also confirmed a European Commission decision from 2016 that Apple should pay 13 billion euros in back taxes in Ireland.\nRegulators are mounting pressure on Alphabet owned Google globally. In March, the EU launched an investigation into Alphabet under its sweeping Digital Markets Act, which scrutinizes the practices of tech companies in Europe.\nIn the U.S. Google is in the midst of an antitrust case brought by the Department of Justice with regard to its advertising business after losing another antitrust case earlier this year.\n\ntitle2:\nSergey Brin says he's working on AI at Google 'pretty much every day'\ndescription2:\nGoogle co-founder and ex-Alphabet president Sergey Brin said he\u2019s back working at Google \u201cpretty much every day\u201d because he hasn\u2019t seen anything as exciting as the recent progress in AI \u2014 and doesn\u2019t want to miss out.\nBrin revealed the tidbit in an interview during the All-In Summit in L.A. this week. Last year, several publications reported that Brin was back at Google HQ working on various AI projects, but the sit-down is the first time Brin has publicly commented on his return.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big, fast-moving field,\u201d Brin said of AI, adding that there is \u201ctremendous value to humanity,\u201d before explaining why he doesn\u2019t think training more capable AI will require massively scaling up compute.\n\u201cI\u2019ve read some articles that extrapolate [compute] \u2026 and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m quite a believer,\u201d he said, \u201cpartly because the algorithmic improvements that have come over the last few years maybe are actually even outpacing the increased compute that\u2019s being put into these models.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nPrice, specs, release date\ndescription3:\nSony on Tuesday announced the PlayStation 5 Pro, an upgraded version of its gaming console that will launch on Nov. 7 for $700.\nThe arrival of Sony's refreshed PS5 console comes amid a global decline in console sales. In August, Sony reported that it sold 2.4 million units of its PlayStation 5 console in the fiscal first quarter, down from 3.3 million in the same period a year ago.\nThe PS5 Pro will have an upgraded graphics card with 67% more compute units than the current standard PS5 model, Sony said, allowing for up to 45% faster rendering of gameplay. Sony also touted new artificial intelligence capabilities that upscale graphics with sharper image clarity and more detailed visuals.\nThe PS5 Pro features \"advanced\" ray tracing, a technique in computer graphics that simulates how light bounces off reflective surfaces.\nSony said the PS5 Pro features a 2-terabyte solid-state drive, larger than the custom-built 825 GB solid-state drive featured in the PS5. It comes with Sony's DualSense Wireless Controller and support for Wi-Fi 7. An Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc Drive will be sold separately.\nSony said several games will have \"PS5 Pro Enhanced\" designation with features that work on the new console. Examples include \"Alan Wake 2,\" \"Assassin's Creed Shadows,\" \"Demon's Souls,\" \"Dragon's Dogma 2,\" \"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth,\" \"Gran Turismo 7,\" \"Hogwarts Legacy,\" \"Horizon Forbidden West,\" \"Marvel's Spider-Man 2,\" \"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart\" and \"The Last of Us Part II Remastered.\"\n\ntitle4:\nSpaceX calls out 'superfluous' regulatory delays holding up Starship flights\ndescription4:\nSpaceX has launched its most public and aggressive offensive against regulators to date, with a blog post published Tuesday urging more expeditious launch licensing \u2014 lest the country lose its place as the leader in the global space race.\nOrbital launch is a tightly regulated industry governed chiefly by the Federal Aviation Administration, though to obtain a launch license from the FAA, companies must also show they are in compliance with local and environmental law. Rockets that operate commercial services regularly, like SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, do so under a blanket vehicle operator license.\nDue to the iterative nature of SpaceX\u2019s Starship heavy lift vehicle test program, which has included updates to hardware and new sets of test objectives with each mission, SpaceX must seek a modification to its vehicle operator license before each launch. These license modifications have taken months each to issue. But SpaceX has had the next test flight hardware ready much sooner and has typically flown within days of receiving each license modification.\nSpaceX is currently awaiting approval for its fifth test flight. The hardware was ready to fly as of the first week of August, but the company recently received a launch license date estimate of late November from the FAA, the blog post says. For the next test, SpaceX is preparing to conduct the most ambitious objective yet in its Starship test program: returning the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catching it in mid-air.\nAs the company acknowledges, a booster catch would be \u201csingularly novel\u201d in the history of rocketry. The only analogue would be the routine Falcon 9 booster landings, but those boosters are significantly smaller than Falcon Heavy and require no infrastructure other than a safe landing zone, like a pad or a barge. In contrast, the company will try to catch Super Heavy using mechanical arms called \u201cchopsticks\u201d attached to Starship\u2019s massive launch tower.\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable that such a unique operation would require additional time to analyze from a licensing perspective,\u201d the company says in the blog post. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d it continues, \u201cinstead of focusing resources on critical safety analysis and collaborating on rational safeguards to protect both the public and the environment, the licensing process has been repeatedly derailed by issues ranging from the frivolous to the patently absurd.\u201d\nThough the space company has already made its arguments before regulators through official filings, leadership there appears to think a more public airing of grievances is warranted.\nThis most recent delay in particular is not based on new safety concerns, SpaceX claims, but \u201csuperfluous environmental analysis\u201d related to multiple aspects of the launches, like the sonic booms and SpaceX\u2019s water deluge system. For example, the FAA recently approved additional 60-day analyses over the sonic booms and the jettisoning of a piece of hardware called the hot-stage into the Gulf of Mexico during flight, two issues that the company says have been \u201cexhaustively analyzed.\u201d\nThese consultations \u201ccould indefinitely delay launch without addressing any plausible impact to the environment,\u201d SpaceX says.\nThe company takes particular umbrage with recent reporting from CNBC on the Starship water deluge system at the Starbase launch facility near Boca Chica, Texas. The water deluge system is used to disperse the enormous amount of heat and sound generated during lift-off. According to CNBC, SpaceX recently received violation notices from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for discharging industrial wastewater without a permit.\nImmediately after the story was published in August, SpaceX hit back on X, saying that the system only uses potable water and that continued operation of the water deluge was explicitly allowed by regulators as the company works on its permit with TCEQ.\nAlthough the company strenuously insists that it was working in good faith with regulators, the FAA nevertheless delayed public meetings related to a separate environmental review at Starbase just a day after the CNBC report was published. In a statement, the FAA said that it \u201cwas unable to confirm the accuracy of certain representations in SpaceX\u2019s license application\u201d after the agency \u201cbecame aware of allegations that SpaceX violated the Clean Water Act at the Boca Chica Launch Site.\u201d\nNow, despite the \u201csmall, but vocal minority of detractors trying to game the regulatory system to obstruct and delay the development of Starship,\u201d SpaceX says it will press on.\"\n\nResponse:",
