Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The San Francisco-based company, ranked No. 12 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, has now raised $1.6 billion to date.\nIts latest funding round is being led by Accel, and includes Cisco Investments, DFJ Growth, Intel Capital, ServiceNow Ventures, AMD Ventures, WCM, Amazon, Elad Gil (co-founder of Color Genomics and serial tech investor), and Meta, all of which are new investors in the company.\nExisting investors including Y Combinator, Nat Friedman, Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Coatue, Thrive Capital, Spark Capital, Nvidia, Tiger Global Management, Greenoaks, and Wellington Management also participated in the round.\nScale AI is playing a key role in the rise of generative artificial intelligence and large language models, with the data \u2014 whether it is text, images, video or voice recordings \u2014 needing to be labeled correctly before it can be digested and used effectively by AI technology. Scale AI has evolved from labeling data used to train models that powered autonomous driving to now helping to improve and fine tune the underlying data for nearly any organization looking to implement AI, powering some of the most advanced models in use.\n\"Our calling is to build the data foundry for AI, and with today's funding, we're moving into the next phase of that journey \u2013 accelerating the abundance of frontier data that will pave our road to AGI,\" founder and CEO Alexandr Wang said in a statement announcing the news.\n\ntitle2:\nEU AI Act, first major law for artificial intelligence, gets final nod\ndescription2:\nIntel Gaudi3 AI accelerator on Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. Intel announced new chips for PCs and data centers that the company hopes will give it a bigger slice of the booming market for artificial intelligence hardware.\nEuropean Union member states on Tuesday gave final agreement to the world's first major law for regulating artificial intelligence, as institutions around the world race to introduce curbs for the technology.\nThe EU Council said it had approved the AI Act \u2014 a groundbreaking piece of regulatory law that sets comprehensive rules surrounding artificial intelligence technology.\n\"The adoption of the AI act is a significant milestone for the European Union,\" Mathieu Michel, Belgium's secretary of state for digitization said in a Tuesday statement.\n\"With the AI act, Europe emphasizes the importance of trust, transparency and accountability when dealing with new technologies while at the same time ensuring this fast-changing technology can flourish and boost European innovation,\" Michel added.\nThe AI Act applies a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the technology are treated differently, depending on the perceived threats they pose to society.\nThe law prohibits applications of AI that are considered \"unacceptable\" in terms of their risk level. Such applications feature so-called \"social scoring\" systems that rank citizens based on aggregation and analysis of their data, predictive policing and emotional recognition in the workplace and schools.\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia is talk of town at AI events before fiscal Q1 2025 earnings\ndescription3:\nIn this article NVDA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang displays products on-stage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024. Josh Edelson | Afp | Getty Images\nAt the start of last week, OpenAI's technology chief personally thanked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for \"bringing us the most advanced\" chips needed to run the demo for a presentation the company delivered on its latest artificial intelligence models. A day later, at Google's annual developer conference, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted his company's \"longstanding partnership with Nvidia,\" and noted that Google Cloud will be using the chipmaker's Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) in early 2025. And this week, Microsoft , which provides servers to OpenAI, will announce new AI advancements and features that were developed on the company's massive clusters of Nvidia GPUs. The company is hosting its Build conference in Redmond, Washington. Heading into its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, Nvidia finds itself at the center of the action in technology, a position that's become increasingly commonplace for the 31-year-old company, whose market cap has ballooned past $2 trillion this year. Nvidia is expected to report year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 200% for a third straight quarter, with analysts projecting a fiscal first-quarter bump-up of 243% to $24.6 billion, according to LSEG. More than $21 billion of that is expected to come from Nvidia's data center business, which includes all the advanced processors the company is selling to Google, Microsoft, Meta , Amazon , OpenAI and others. Nvidia is squeezing so much profit out of its AI suite of products that net income is expected to be up more than fivefold from a year earlier to $13.9 billion. The stock has soared 91% this year after more than tripling in 2023.\nwatch now\nDan Niles, founder of Niles Investment Management, compared Nvidia's position in the AI boom to the \"internet buildout\" of the 1990s and Cisco's role at the center in those days. Over a three-year stretch, Niles said, Cisco had several dramatic pullbacks, but ultimately increased 4,000% up to its peak in 2000. Nvidia will go through similar cycles, he said. \"We're still really early in the AI build,\" Niles told CNBC's \"Money Matters\" on Monday. \"I think the revenue will go up three to four times from current levels over the next three to four years, and I think the stock goes with it.\" Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple are expected to shell out a combined $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, according to an estimate from Bernstein, with a huge portion of the spending going to AI-specific infrastructure like Nvidia chips. Elsewhere, OpenAI is relying on Nvidia's technology for its latest chatbot, GPT-4o. Meta announced plans in March to buy and build out computers that will include 350,000 Nvidia GPUs, costing billions of dollars, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg even swapped jackets with Huang and posed for a picture with the Nvidia CEO. \"If you look at today for the AI build out, who's really driving that?\" Niles said. \"It's the most profitable companies on the planet \u2014 it's Microsoft, it's Google, it's Meta, and they're driving this.\"\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., arrives at an event in Taipei, Taiwan, on Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024. Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nPrior to the recent AI boom, Nvidia was known as the primary maker of chips used for 3D gaming. About a year ago, the chipmaker gave investors their first clue that the company would see a period of historic growth, signaling to Wall Street that it would generate about 50% more in sales than what analysts expected in the July 2023 quarter. Growth rates have since accelerated. But starting in the second quarter, expansion is expected to slow, with analysts anticipating significant deceleration in each of the next three periods. \"We just don't know how long this investment cycle lasts and just how much excess capacity will be created over that time in case this AI thing doesn't materialize as quickly as expected,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note earlier this month. That's not to say that Nvidia is at risk of losing a ton of the AI chip business to rivals. Piper Sandler analysts expect it to keep at least 75% of the AI accelerator market, even as companies like Google build their own custom chips. \"We view the percentage of hyperscaler spend that is dedicated towards compute further rising in 2024 and 2025,\" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar wrote in a note. One question the company faces is how well the transition is going to its next generation of AI chips, called Blackwell, which are expected to ship later this year. Some worry there could be a lull as clients hold off on buying the older Hopper GPUs like the H100 in favor of Blackwell-based chips such as the GH200. \"To some degree, the setup has shifted,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore in a note on Monday. \"Six months ago, short term expectations were very strong but there was anxiety about durability. Now, fresh on the back of hyperscalers talking up longer term spending expectations for AI, those longer term views are more positive, but there is anxiety about a pause in front of Blackwell.\"\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft is making File Explorer more powerful with version control and 7z compression\ndescription4:\nHere\u2019s one more way to stay on top of your favorite programming projects: have them sync to the same File Explorer you already use to navigate your hard drive in Windows.\nAt Build, Microsoft now says it\u2019s adding native version control to File Explorer by integrating systems like Git, letting you see new changes and comments directly from the app.\nHere\u2019s a cropped and zoomed version of the provided screenshot so you can get a better look:\nI wonder if this would also let non-programmers keep the latest copies of a project they like synced to their hard drive. I can think of a few projects I like where that\u2019d come in handy.\nMicrosoft says it\u2019s also letting File Explorer natively compress files to 7-zip and TAR; currently, the right-click context menu has a \u201cCompress to ZIP file\u201d option, but ZIP is thought to be a bit antiquated in terms of how much compression you get.\"\n\nResponse:",
