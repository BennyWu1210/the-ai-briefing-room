Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday September 3), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nA16z\u2019s Joshua Lu says AI is already radically changing video games and Discord is the future\ndescription0:\nAndreessen Horowitz\u2019s partner Joshua Lu knows that, in the video game industry, you can never get too comfortable. When he was head of product at Zynga, he experienced the height of mobile games, working on hits like Words with Friends; then as a vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, he helped produce tentpole hits like Diablo Immortal. And then, as a director of product management at Meta, he learned to see games in new dimensions while working on the VR game, Horizon Worlds.\n\u201cI had to forget what I thought were universal truths and learn a whole new set of ways to do things,\u201d Lu told TechCrunch.\nNow Lu wants a front row seat to where video games are heading. After joining the firm as an investor in 2022, Lu helped launch the firm\u2019s Speedrun accelerator, which invests $750,000 apiece into about 40 gaming startups twice a year. Now on the firm\u2019s third cohort \u2014 with the applications for the fourth cohort now open \u2014 Lu said he\u2019s seen how AI and new distribution platforms are changing the industry.\nHalf of the accelerator\u2019s current batch are AI companies, doing everything from creating AI-crafted stories to using AI for 3D avatars. \u201cThe last game that I worked on at Blizzard took six years and a $250 million budget to ship,\u201d he said, referring to Diablo Immortal. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be so great if that kind of quality of game could be done with a 10th of the budget and a 10th of the people?\u201d\nWe might quibble with how great it is for AI to kill high-paying developer jobs at the largest game companies. But if AI also helps more startups form and be qualitatively competitive, that\u2019s a compelling thought.\nLu says he\u2019s seen firsthand how companies are getting creative, citing Clementine, a startup that went through Speedrun. The company \u201creleased a demo where you had to solve a mystery by talking to AI and making sure that they didn\u2019t find out that you were a human,\u201d he said. That may be a terrifying premise, or a tongue-in-cheek one, depending on how existential a threat you think AI could become.\nLu also mentioned Echo Chunk, a company that raised $1.4 million in a round led by Speedrun. Echo Chunk went viral for its game Echo Chess that uses AI to instantly generate an endless number of levels. \u201cThese are all fairly early explorations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re excited in general about novel types of game design interactions and game dynamics that can be unlocked because of AI.\u201d\nLu is also advocating for startups to build games atop Discord. Earlier this year, Discord made it so developers can create apps for people to use within the chatting platform. Lu said that, over the course of his career, he\u2019s seen the places for people to discover games dwindle; for example, no one finds games through social media feeds anymore, like many did with Farmville. \u201cWhere can we find the next platform where truly social games can be created and distributed?\u201d Lu said.\nSeveral companies entered the accelerator building within Discord. Lu said several more pivoted to building in Discord over the course of the 12-weeks. \u201cThere are more games being made than ever, and it\u2019s hard for developers to stand out,\u201d he said. He hopes building on Discord will help \u201cpeople to find pieces of content that they would really like playing.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nCrowdStrike faces onslaught of legal action from faulty software update\ndescription1:\nWhen the now infamous CrowdStrike software update took down companies all over the world in July, it was inevitable that lawsuits would follow \u2014 and follow they have. Delta suing the company for as much as $500 million in damages and hiring lawyer David Boies is perhaps the highest-profile example.\nAmong Boies\u2019 wide range of high-profile clients are Theranos, Harvey Weinstein, victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Al Gore in Bush v. Gore around the results of the 2000 presidential election. He also led the government\u2019s antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s.\nEven before Delta came forward, shareholders were looking for their pound of flesh, filing a class action lawsuit against CrowdStrike alleging that the company had misled them regarding its software update procedures.\nFor its part, CrowdStrike hired the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to defend the company against the expected onslaught of legal action, giving credence to the idea that lawyers were going to make big bucks off of this mistake.\nTo a lesser extent, Microsoft has also been drawn into the battle because the faulty CrowdStrike software update only affected Windows machines.\nBut for the most part, it\u2019s CrowdStrike\u2019s cross to bear, and it is facing a daunting legal challenge, says Rob Wilkins, who works at Florida law firm Jones Foster, where he co-chairs the complex litigation and dispute resolution practice group. What could save CrowdStrike, however, is contractual limits on damages, which are typically built into enterprise software contracts.\n\u201cWhat I found was interesting is that there\u2019s a contractual limit on damages between CrowdStrike and Delta, and I assume that there\u2019s going to be a similar type of contractual limit on damages in the other customers\u2019 contracts,\u201d Wilkins told TechCrunch.\nDelta is alleging, however, that the bad software update amounted to gross negligence or willful misconduct on CrowdStrike\u2019s part, which could potentially void the contractual cap. Delta service was disrupted for five days, compared with United, which faced only three days of CloudStrike-related delays. CrowdStrike says that Delta has had issues with its own internal systems and that the company can\u2019t attribute the entire outage to the faulty update from CrowdStrike.\nWilkins says Delta could have problems proving gross negligence or willful misconduct, which carries a significant burden of proof. Shareholders alleging the company misled and defrauded them by not warning them about their lack of a software testing regimen also face significant challenges proving that in court.\n\u201cIt comes down to: Was CrowdStrike intentionally misrepresenting or failing to tell the investors that it was completely up to date with respect to all of its security procedures and control procedures with respect to its software platform?\u201d Wilkins said.\nWilkins says that whatever happens, the individual companies suing CrowdStrike will likely come together to file a class action suit against the company because individual suits will get costly and unwieldy for everyone involved. It\u2019s worth noting, he says, that once there is a class action, that tends to attract more companies that want to be included.\n\u201cTypically with class actions, people pile on, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s the case, and then you see everything being consolidated into a by the multidistrict litigation panel, assigning all the cases across the country to one particular federal district court for all discovery-related purposes \u2014 and that cuts down significantly on the process,\u201d he said.\nOnce that is in place, there tends to be a \u201cbellwether\u201d trial, where one case is floated as a test case for all the other plaintiffs in the class action, and however the jury decides, that\u2019s a road map for other settlements moving forward. \u201cThen you can go back to CrowdStrike and say, \u2018Look, you got hit for $20 million by this one company, and we\u2019ve got 15 other companies that are suing you in these class actions with the same facts, etc., you should settle,\u2019\u201d he said.\nOne other complicating factor is the role of insurance companies, which would be covering CrowdStrike and its customers against possible damages in these cases. The customers\u2019 insurance companies might be coming after CrowdStrike as well to get back some portion of the payments they made.\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably insurance there, and they\u2019re probably going to have the carrier come in, and usually they defend these things. While I haven\u2019t seen their specific policy, in cybersecurity policies that I reviewed, it would cover this type of negligence. And so it depends on what they have, and what exclusions they have in their policy, but I do see insurance being a part of it.\u201d\nIn addition to the monetary issues, Wilkins says there is a reputational component, and the sooner this all goes away, the sooner CrowdStrike can move forward. The company has hired good attorneys to defend itself, but at the end of the day, the company will have to make peace with shareholders and customers, relationships that are key to the success of any business.\n\u201cIt seems to me that their approach to this is going to be to fight, but also to fight with the understanding that they really need to resolve it and move on, so that\u2019s what I would expect.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nBrazilian Supreme Court panel upholds X ban, while Starlink refuses to comply\ndescription2:\nA panel of five Brazilian Supreme Court justices voted Monday to uphold a decision (PDF) requiring the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to limit access to X, the service formerly known as Twitter. Justice Alexandre de Moraes issued the ban on Friday in response to X owner Elon Musk\u2019s refusal to comply with court orders to block certain accounts and to identify a legal representative in the country. Four other justices have now backed the decision.\nPoder360 and The Globe report that three justices, Cristiano Zanin, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, and C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, fully supported de Moraes\u2019 ruling, while a fourth, Luiz Fux, noted reservations about a fine for people who circumvent the ban with a VPN, saying only people who post criminal messages like those expressing Nazism or fascism should be fined.\nAs far as the ban\u2019s effect, competing platforms have reported large numbers of new accounts made by Brazilian users. News organization Poder360 noted that its X account will now be managed exclusively from Portugal to respect the judge\u2019s decision.\nMeanwhile, Starlink has told Brazil\u2019s telecom regulator, Anatel, that it will not comply with the ban until the court unfreezes its assets. So far, X is reportedly still accessible via the service. The New York Times reports de Moraes has blocked Starlink from making Brazilian transactions while the court seeks to collect $3 million in unpaid fines by X. The satellite-based internet service is operated by SpaceX, which is also partially owned by Musk.\n\ntitle3:\nHuawei plans Sept. 10 launch event just hours after Apple iPhone launch\ndescription3:\nThe Huawei flagship store and the Apple flagship store are seen at Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street in Shanghai, China, September 2, 2024.\nHuawei said Monday it plans to hold a product launch event this month just hours after Apple 's annual iPhone reveal as the Chinese technology giant looks to upstage its U.S. rival.\nThe event will take place on Sept. 10 at 2:30 p.m. Beijing time, Huawei said in a post on Chinese X-like service Weibo on Monday.\nThat timing would be late evening on Sept. 9 on the west coast of the U.S., where Apple's event is set to take place.\nApple is expected to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup on the morning of Sept. 9 at its event which features the tagline \"It's Glowtime\".\nIt's unclear what Huawei plans to launch at its event. Richard Yu, who heads up Huawei's consumer and automotive technology group, said the company's \"leading, innovative, and disruptive product is here,\" according to a Google translation of his Weibo post on Monday.\n\"This is an epoch-making product that others have thought of but cannot make,\" Yu said.\nThe executive added that after five years of investment, Huawei has \"turned science fiction into reality.\"\n\ntitle4:\nSign or veto: What's next for California's AI disaster bill, SB 1047?\ndescription4:\nA controversial California bill to prevent AI disasters, SB 1047, has passed final votes in the state\u2019s Senate and now proceeds to Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk. He must weigh the most extreme theoretical risks of AI systems \u2014 including their potential role in human deaths \u2014 against potentially thwarting California\u2019s AI boom. He has until September 30 to sign SB 1047 into law, or veto it altogether.\nIntroduced by state senator Scott Wiener, SB 1047 aims to prevent the possibility of very large AI models creating catastrophic events, such as loss of life or cyberattacks costing more than $500 million in damages.\nTo be clear, very few AI models exist today that are large enough to be covered by the bill, and AI has never been used for a cyberattack of this scale. But the bill concerns the future of AI models, not problems that exist today.\nSB 1047 would make AI model developers liable for their harms \u2014 like making gun manufacturers liable for mass shootings \u2014 and would grant California\u2019s attorney general the power to sue AI companies for hefty penalties if their technology was used in a catastrophic event. In the event that a company is acting recklessly, a court can order them to stop operations; covered models must also have a \u201ckill switch\u201d that lets them be shut down if they are deemed dangerous.\nThe bill could reshape America\u2019s AI industry, and it is a signature away from becoming law. Here is how the future of SB 1047 might play out.\nWhy Newsom might sign it\nWiener argues that Silicon Valley needs more liability, previously telling TechCrunch that America must learn from its past failures in regulating technology. Newsom could be motivated to act decisively on AI regulation and hold Big Tech to account.\nA few AI executives have emerged as cautiously optimistic about SB 1047, including Elon Musk.\nAnother cautious optimist on SB 1047 is Microsoft\u2019s former chief AI officer Sophia Velastegui. She told TechCrunch that \u201cSB 1047 is a good compromise,\u201d while admitting the bill is not perfect. \u201cI think we need an office of responsible AI for America, or any country that works on it. It shouldn\u2019t be just Microsoft,\u201d said Velastegui.\nAnthropic is another cautious proponent of SB 1047, though the company hasn\u2019t taken an official position on the bill. Several of the startup\u2019s suggested changes were added to SB 1047, and CEO Dario Amodei now says the bill\u2019s \u201cbenefits likely outweigh its costs\u201d in a letter to California\u2019s governor. Thanks to Anthropic\u2019s amendments, AI companies can only be sued after their AI models cause some catastrophic harm, not before, as a previous version of SB 1047 stated.\nWhy Newsom might veto it\nGiven the loud industry opposition to the bill, it would not be surprising if Newsom vetoed it. He would be hanging his reputation on SB 1047 if he signs it, but if he vetoes, he could kick the can down the road another year or let Congress handle it.\n\u201cThis [SB 1047] changes the precedent for which we\u2019ve dealt with software policy for 30 years,\u201d argued Andreessen Horowitz general partner Martin Casado in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cIt shifts liability away from applications, and applies it to infrastructure, which we\u2019ve never done.\u201d\nThe tech industry has responded with a resounding outcry against SB 1047. Alongside a16z, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, OpenAI, Big Tech trade groups, and notable AI researchers are also urging Newsom to not sign the bill. They worry that this paradigm shift on liability will have a chilling effect on California\u2019s AI innovation.\nA chilling effect on the startup economy is the last thing anyone wants. The AI boom has been a huge stimulant for the American economy, and Newsom is facing pressure not to squander that. Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has asked Newsom to veto the bill, saying \u201cAI is foundational to America\u2019s economic growth,\u201d in a letter to him.\nIf SB 1047 becomes law\nIf Newsom signs the bill, nothing happens on day one, a source involved with drafting SB 1047 tells TechCrunch.\nBy January 1, 2025, tech companies would need to write safety reports for their AI models. At this point, California\u2019s attorney general could request an injunctive order, requiring an AI company to stop training or operating their AI models if a court finds them to be dangerous.\nIn 2026, more of the bill kicks into gear. At that point, the Board of Frontier Models would be created and start collecting safety reports from tech companies. The nine-person board, selected by California\u2019s governor and legislature, would make recommendations to California\u2019s attorney general about which companies do and do not comply.\nThat same year, SB 1047 would also require that AI model developers hire auditors to assess their safety practices, effectively creating a new industry for AI safety compliance. And California\u2019s attorney general would be able to start suing AI model developers if their tools are used in catastrophic events.\nBy 2027, the Board of Frontier Models could start issuing guidance to AI model developers on how to safely and securely train and operate AI models.\nIf SB 1047 gets vetoed\nIf Newsom vetoes SB 1047, OpenAI\u2019s desires would come true, and federal regulators would likely take the lead on regulating AI models \u2026eventually.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI and Anthropic laid the groundwork for what federal AI regulation would look like. They agreed to give the AI Safety Institute, a federal body, early access to their advanced AI models, according to a press release. At the same time, OpenAI has endorsed a bill that would let the AI Safety Institute set standards for AI models.\n\u201cFor many reasons, we think it\u2019s important that this happens at the national level,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a tweet on Thursday.\nReading between the lines, federal agencies typically produce less onerous tech regulation than California does and take considerably longer to do so. But more than that, Silicon Valley has historically been an important tactical and business partner for the United States government.\n\u201cThere actually is a long history of state-of-the-art computer systems working with the feds,\u201d said Casado. \u201cWhen I worked for the national labs, every time a new supercomputer would come out, the very first version would go to the government. We would do it so the government had capabilities, and I think that\u2019s a better reason than for safety testing.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
