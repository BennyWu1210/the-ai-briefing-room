Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday June 11), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nHere\u2019s everything Apple announced at the WWDC 2024 keynote, including Apple Intelligence, Siri makeover\ndescription0:\nIt\u2019s WWDC 2024 keynote time! Each year Apple kicks off its Worldwide Developers Conference with a few hours of just straight announcements, like the long-awaited Apple Intelligence and a makeover for smart AI assistant, Siri. We expected much of them to revolve around the company\u2019s artificial intelligence ambitions (and here), and Apple didn\u2019t disappoint. We also bring you news about Vision Pro and lots of feature refreshes.\nHere\u2019s how to watch the archive of WWDC 2024.\nDevelopers should expect hardware and software updates, per the usual, and some other items we initially thought would be unveiled. Brian Heater also went on Equity to dish. Now sit back and relax while the team runs down all of the biggest news in an easy-to-skim digest.\nApple to work with AI partners beyond OpenAI\nIn a post-keynote event, Apple SVP Craig Federighi confirmed that the company would work with other third-party models beyond OpenAI, with Google\u2019s Gemini model being highlighted as the first example. He clarified that Apple had \u201cnothing to announce right now, but that\u2019s our general direction.\u201d Read more\nElon Musk lumps OpenAI, Apple together\nTesla, SpaceX and xAI exec Elon Musk took to X to continue his campaign against rival OpenAI, threatening to ban Apple devices from his businesses \u201cif Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level,\u201d among other responses and reactions to the conversations around WWDC on X. Read more\nApple Intelligence\u2019s (limited) availability\nBefore you get too excited about putting Apple Intelligence to the test, check if your devices are new enough. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, along with iPads and Macs with M1 or newer chips, will be able to run the new features coming alongside Apple\u2019s AI push. Read more\nChatGPT in Siri\nApple is bringing ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot experience, to Siri and other Apple apps, powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and other generative AI models. Read more\nApple Intelligence is an image and emoji playground\nImage Credits: Apple\nOne of the Apple Intelligence-powered features coming in iOS 18 will allow iPhone users to create AI images of people they\u2019re messaging with \u2014 a feature that works something like an AI-upgraded Bitmoji. The goal, of course, is to make your \u201ceveryday conversations more enjoyable.\u201d\nApple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you\u2019re talking with in a messaging conversation, so if you want to personalize that chat with a custom AI image, you can create one on the fly. Read more\nApple TV+\nImage Credits: Apple\nFor those of you who use Apple TV+, there is a new feature called InSight. The feature will allow viewers to learn actor names and song titles as they appear on the screen. Lauren Forristal writes that it\u2019s similar to Amazon\u2019s X-Ray technology, where Fire TV users get an overview of actor bios and behind-the-scenes information while watching TV shows and movies.\nWhat stands out about InSight, however, is its Shazam-like functionality, which highlights the song playing in the TV show or movie and gives users the option to add it to an Apple Music playlist to listen to later. Read more\nSiri\nImage Credits: Apple\nApple also made some enhancements to its smart assistant, Siri. These include adding some generative AI features that make Siri seem more natural and more personal. There\u2019s also a new glowing light. And, Siri can also handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. Plus, for those who would rather type, you can do that now. Read more\nApple Intelligence is here\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.\n\u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more,\u201d CEO Tim Cook noted at WWDC Monday. \u201cAnd of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\u201d Read more\nThat covers the consumer side of things, but WWDC is a conference for developers, and Apple revealed how developers will soon be able to bring the Apple Intelligence experience into their software. A number of AI features will be added to existing SDKs, allowing for generative AI image generation, or new prompts to Siri, to allow devs to expand the Apple Intelligence footprint. Read more\nApple\u2019s new Passwords app\nImage Credits: Apple\nWhile you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn\u2019t easy to figure out. Now, the company introduced a Passwords app. Some of the features include a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren\u2019t related to a website or service. Read more\nSmart Script in iPad\nImage Credits: Apple\nA new \u201cSmart Script\u201d feature will clean up your handwriting when using an Apple Pencil to write in Notes. Apple says it\u2019s making handwriting your notes even smoother and straighter. The feature improves the appearance of your writing as you write by using on-device machine learning to recreate your handwriting from your notes. You\u2019ll see your own handwriting, just smoother and more legible. Read more\nCalculator for iPad\nImage Credits: Apple\nWho would have thought a calculator would liven up a developer\u2019s conference? Well, Apple\u2019s new Calculator for iPad app got everyone excited.\niOS\u2019 perennial tips calculating app is finally coming to the larger screen. The feature utilizes the additional screen real estate to bring new features that the company couldn\u2019t really jam into the iPhone. The biggest arrival here is the addition of Math Notes. The additional feature does the math for you. Read more\nmacOS Sequoia\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe latest operating system version is called macOS Sequoia.\nOne of the biggest features of this new OS is iPhone mirroring. Now, through macOS\u2019 Continuity feature, you can mirror your iPhone\u2019s screen and control it right from your Mac. Notifications on Mac pop you into iPhone mirror mode, and iPhone audio comes through the Mac as well, but the paired iPhone stays locked while in mirror mode. Read more\nOK, let\u2019s do a little deeper dive into iPhone mirroring. While Apple didn\u2019t detail many use cases for the feature, Sarah Perez writes that it seems it would make it easier to demo apps over video calls or in person, as users could move between a slideshow presentation and a live demo of the iPhone app by launching it as if it\u2019s another app on your Mac. Read more\nMessages via Satellite\nImage Credits: Apple\nThis new feature works much like Apple\u2019s emergency SOS feature. When you have no signal, you\u2019ll be given the option to find a satellite to relay the data. You\u2019ll have to keep the phone pointed in the right direction while you do it, however, there\u2019s an overlay above your messages to remind you. Read more\nPhotos app\nImage Credits: Apple\nApple showed off the new Photos app as it will appear in the upcoming release of the iOS software. The new app introduces new navigation, new organizational features and other ways to discover your favorite photos, including those of friends, family, pets, trips and more.\nSome things to know: The new design will lead to less time searching for photos as it puts everything you need within easy reach.\nOne major change involves how the app has been unified into a single view with the photo grid at the top and the library, organized by theme, below. Read more\nTap to Cash\nOne of the more interesting additions is Tap to Cash, which is more or less what it sounds like, letting users pay for things by tapping together a pair of iPhones.\nAs Brian Heater writes, the feature is effectively an outgrowth of Apple Pay\u2019s longstanding Tap to Pay feature. Similarly, the new addition likely uses the device\u2019s NFC functionality. Apple notes that the feature transfers money without having to share any personal info \u2014 a nice added privacy element. Read more\niOS 18\nImage Credits: Apple\nUsers will now be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game. When you lock an app, if someone tries to tap your phone, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or their passcode. While you have the app lock feature enabled, information from inside the app won\u2019t appear in other places, like search and notifications. Read more\nApple also shared some initial details for the upcoming major release of iOS, which is its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone. As expected, much of this involves artificial intelligence. Remember when icons were locked to the grid? Well, they can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don\u2019t hide your background photos.\n\u201ciOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,\u201d Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. Read more\nSpeaking of icons, most of these updates are those long-requested functionalities, like the ability to set app icons and widgets wherever you want on the Home Screen, plus support for dark mode icons with different color schemes. Read more\nvisionOS 2\nImage Credits: Apple\nvisionOS 2 brings with it productivity enhancements and \u201cnew immersive experiences.\u201d One lets you \u201cspatialize\u201d photos from regular photos, leveraging AI tech. Another is a new navigation option: visionOS 2 lets you switch to the home screen by just tapping, or flip your hand over to bring up the control center with notifications, shortcuts and more. Read more\nOne of the bigger announcements with this includes the ability to turn existing images into spatial photos. The new feature utilizes machine learning to build out additional angles, marking a change from the existing method, which required images to be shot on an iPhone 15 Pro or the Vision Pro itself. Read more\nFor those of you outside of the U.S., the Vision Pro headset will be available in eight new countries. Read more\nUseful AI, not flashy AI\nApple has fallen behind its peers in the AI race, and it probably feels like it needs to pull out all the stops to impress fans and shareholders. But that shouldn\u2019t mean overpromising on features. Read more\nGenerative AI\nFor smart assistants: While rumors point to the company transitioning a number of employees to generative AI operations following its electric car implosion, all signs point to Apple having ceded a significant head start to the competition. As such, its most logical play is a partnership with a reigning powerhouse like OpenAI. Read more\nMaybe not for iPhone 15: Some other rumors say that when this generative AI comes into play, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro. That means the standard iPhone 15 may be left out in the cold on this one. Read more\n\ntitle2:\nApple Intelligence is the company's new generative AI offering\ndescription2:\nOn Monday at WWDC 2024, Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence, its long-awaited, ecosystem-wide push into generative AI. As earlier rumors suggested, the new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.\n\u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more,\u201d CEO Tim Cook noted. \u201cAnd of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\u201d\nThe company has been pushing the feature as integral to all of its various operating system offerings, including iOS, macOS and the latest, visionOS.\nImage Credits: Apple\n\u201cIt has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences. Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more and of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up. Together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\u201d\nSVP Craig Federighi added, \u201cApple Intelligence is grounded in your personal data and context.\u201d The feature will effectively build upon all of the personal data that users input into applications like Calendar and Maps.\nThe system is built on large language and intelligence models. Much of that processing is done locally according to the company, utilizes the latest version of Apple silicon. \u201cMany of these models run entirely on device,\u201d Federighi claimed during the event.\nThat said, these consumer systems still have limitations. As such, some of the heavy lifting needs to be done off device in the cloud. Apple is adding Private Cloud Compute to the offering. The back end uses services that run Apple chips, in a bid to increase privacy for this highly personal data.\nApple Intelligence also includes what is likely the biggest update to Siri since it was announced more than a decade ago. The company says the feature is \u201cmore deeply integrated\u201d into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, that means trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use.\nSiri is no longer just a voice interface. Apple is also adding the ability to type queries directly into the system to access its generative AI-based intelligence. It\u2019s an acknowledgment that voice is often not the best interface for these systems.\nImage Credits: Apple\nApp Intents, meanwhile, brings the ability to integrate the assistant more directly into different apps. That will start with first-party applications, but the company will also be opening up access to third parties. That addition will dramatically improve the kinds of things that Siri can do directly.\nThe offering will also open up multitasking in a profound way, allowing a kind of cross-app compatibility. That means, for instance, that users won\u2019t have to keep switching between Calendar, Mail and Maps in order to schedule meetings, for example.\nApple Intelligence will be integrated into most of the company\u2019s apps. That includes things like the ability to help compose messages inside Mail (along with third-party apps) or just utilize Smart Replies to respond. This is, notably, a feature Google has offered for some time now in Gmail and has continued to build out using its own generative AI model, Gemini.\nThe company is even bringing the feature to emojis with Genmoji (yep, that\u2019s the name). The feature uses a text field to build customized emojis. Image Playground, meanwhile, is an on-device image generator that is built into apps like Messages, Keynote, Pages and Freeform. Apple is also bringing a stand-alone Image Playground app to iOS and opening up access to the offering via an API.\nImage Credits: Apple\nImage Wand, meanwhile, is a new tool for Apple Pencil that lets users circle text to create an image. Effectively it\u2019s Apple\u2019s take on Google\u2019s Circle to Search, only focused on images.\nSearch has been built, as well, for content like photos and videos. The company promises more natural language searches inside of these applications. The GenAI models also make it easier to build slideshows inside of Photos, again using natural language prompts. Apple Intelligence will be rolling out to the latest versions of its operating systems, including iOS and iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia and visionOS 2. It\u2019s available for free with those updates.\nThe feature will be coming to iPhone 15 Pro and M1 Mac and iPad devices. The standard iPhone 15 will not be getting the feature, likely owing to limitations of the chip.\nAs expected, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to offerings like Siri. The GPT 4.0-powered feature utilizes that company\u2019s image and text generation. The offering will give users access without having to sign up for an account or pay a fee (though they can still upgrade to premium).\nThat\u2019s arriving for iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year. The company says it will also be bringing integration to other third-party LLMs, though didn\u2019t offer much detail. It seems likely that Google\u2019s Gemini is near the top of that list.\n\ntitle3:\nApple brings ChatGPT to its apps, including Siri\ndescription3:\nApple is bringing ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot experience, to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. The tech giant announced the news during a keynote at WWDC 2024 in Cupertino on Monday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. \u201cApple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI\u2019s mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone.\u201d\nSoon, Siri will be able to tap ChatGPT for \u201cexpertise\u201d where it might be helpful, Apple says. For example, if you need menu ideas for a meal to make for friends using some ingredients from your garden, you can ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT for an answer after you give it permission to do so.\nYou can include photos with the questions you ask ChatGPT via Siri, or ask questions related to your docs or PDFs. Apple\u2019s also integrated ChatGPT into system-wide writing tools like Writing Tools, which lets you create content with ChatGPT \u2014 including images \u2014 or ask an initial idea and send it to ChatGPT to get a revision or variation back.\nChatGPT integrations will arrive on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year, Apple says, and will be free without the need to create a ChatGPT or OpenAI account. Initially, they\u2019ll be powered by GPT-4o, OpenAI\u2019s recently introduced flagship generative AI model.\nSubscribers to one of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT premium plans will be able to access paid features within Siri and Apple\u2019s other apps with ChatGPT integrations. Apple says that privacy protections are \u201cbuilt in\u201d to the integrations \u2014 specifically, requests aren\u2019t stored by OpenAI and users\u2019 IP addresses are obscured.\n\ntitle4:\nApple announces macOS Sequoia at WWDC 2024\ndescription4:\nApple officially announced macOS 15 Sequoia at WWDC 2024 on Monday, with Apple Intelligence, iPhone mirroring, Continuity updates, automatic window tiling \u2014 finally \u2014 and a cross-platform Passwords app. The developer beta is available today, with public betas in July. The full version releases in fall 2024.\nMost significantly, macOS Sequoia will include Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that work across iPhone, iPad, and iOS. Among the features mentioned at WWDC: Writing Tools, a systemwide feature that can summarize text in emails and other apps and automatically draft replies to emails.
