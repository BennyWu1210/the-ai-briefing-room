Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday July 3), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla (TSLA) Q2 vehicle deliveries and production numbers\ndescription0:\nTesla shares jumped 10% on Tuesday after the company posted second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers that beat analyst expectations.\nHere are the key numbers:\nTotal deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles\nTotal production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles\nAnalysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter fell 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier but rose 14.8% from the first quarter.\nThe stock closed Tuesday at $231.26, and is down about 7% in 2024.\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories \u2014 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles \u2014 but doesn't report numbers for individual models or specific regions.\nTesla's current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.\nIn April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported a 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, \"primarily due to lower average selling price.\"\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shutdowns initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla's factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\ntitle1:\nSpaceX wants to launch up to 120 times a year from Florida \u2014 and competitors aren\u2019t happy about it\ndescription1:\nSpaceX\u2019s ambitious plans to launch its Starship mega-rocket up to 44 times per year from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center are causing a stir among some of its competitors. Late last month, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance submitted comments calling on regulators to ensure minimal disruptions to other launch providers in the area, with Blue Origin even suggesting limiting Starship operations to particular times \u2014 and giving other launch providers a right of first refusal for conflicting launches.\nBut SpaceX may have even more ambitious plans for a second launch pad right next door: Space Launch Complex (SLC)-37 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS). At a series of public meetings held in March, the public was invited to comment on plans to launch Starship from SLC-37 up to 76 times per year. That would mean SpaceX aims to launch its next-gen rocket up to 120 times per year within a six-mile area on the Florida coast.\nThe U.S. Space Force is currently preparing the draft environmental assessment that will be released to the public this winter, and that document will contain SpaceX\u2019s final anticipated launch cadence. A Space Force representative stressed to TechCrunch that launch cadence numbers could change from now until then. Such numbers could be influenced by the pace of Starship\u2019s development in the coming months or even by the number of scrub jay nests discovered during the EA process. Scrub jays, a bird native to Florida, are listed as threatened on the Endangered Species list.\nHowever, as recently as a few weeks ago, SpaceX\u2019s competitors were still using the number 76 as a benchmark for the company\u2019s plans, according to a person familiar with the talks. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.\nScaling in Florida and Texas\nSLC-37 is a historic launch pad at CCSFS, home to NASA\u2019s Saturn rocket in the 1960s and, more recently, United Launch Alliance\u2019s Delta IV series rockets. The pad is now inactive after ULA flew its Delta IV Heavy for the final time in April. The Space Force announced in February that it was preparing to kick off what\u2019s known as an environmental impact statement, a sweeping regulatory document that examines the environmental impacts of the proposed activities, regarding Starship launches from that pad.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is preparing a separate impact statement for SpaceX\u2019s Starship launch plans at Kennedy Space Center\u2019s pad 39A. Both studies are meant to examine the environmental impacts of Starship launches and landing operations, which will involve the Super Heavy boosters returning to the launch site, similar to how SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets operate.\nThe Space Force\u2019s environmental impact statement for SLC-37 is also considering an alternative \u2014 having SpaceX construct an entirely new launch pad currently designated SLC-50. Either way, there would likely be significant construction, including deluge ponds, fuel tanks, a catch tower \u2014 and then upwards of 120 launches per year from both sites combined.\nThe two Florida launch pads would join an existing Starship launch tower at SpaceX\u2019s Starbase launch facility in southeast Texas, as well as a second tower that\u2019s currently under construction at the same location. In the near future, SpaceX could have four operational Starship launch sites.\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has incredibly ambitious plans for Starship, which he sees as a key enabler for colonizing Mars and \u201cexpanding the light of consciousness\u201d through the cosmos. He eventually wants to launch Starship multiple times per day, with each launch delivering hundreds of tons of cargo to low Earth orbit or beyond. The company has a separate goal of beefing up its Starship manufacturing facilities to enable producing one Starship second stage per day.\nBlue Origin, ULA push back\nAs part of the preparation process, the public is invited to comment on the scope of the plans before a draft environmental impact statement is published. While the public comments on SLC-37 have not yet been released, the comments on pad 39A at Kennedy were \u2014 and they included strong statements from Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance on the plans there. Both companies expressed particular concern on the effects such a high flight rate would have on other launch providers with infrastructure at Kennedy and Cape Canaveral.\n\u201cJust one Starship launch site is likely to disrupt other launch operations in the area and cause significant environmental impacts, as discussed in detail below. The impacts are certain to be amplified if coming from two launch sites in such close proximity,\u201d ULA said in its comment.\n\u201cFor example, SpaceX intends to conduct up to 44 launches per year from LC-39A. If SpaceX aims for a comparable number at SLC-37, that would lead to nearly 100 launches per year\u2014or one every three days or so,\u201d the comment continued.\nBlue Origin, which aims to launch its New Glenn rocket from LC-36 at the Cape Canaveral site, proposed a number of mitigating factors that made it clear it views the launch operations across both sites as a zero-sum game. Those included a suggestion to require SpaceX (or the government) to indemnify third parties for losses caused by Starship operations \u2014 including commercial disruptions.\n\ntitle4:\nFigma disables its AI design feature that appeared to be ripping off Apple's Weather app\ndescription4:\nFigma CEO Dylan Field says the company will temporarily disable its \u201cMake Design\u201d AI feature that was said to be ripping off the designs of Apple\u2019s own Weather app. The problem was first spotted by Andy Allen, the founder of NotBoring Software, which makes a suite of apps that includes a popular, skinnable Weather app and other utilities. He found by testing Figma\u2019s tool that it would repeatedly reproduce Apple\u2019s Weather app when used as a design aid.\nAllen had taken to X, formerly Twitter, to accuse Figma of \u201cheavily\u201d training its tool on existing apps \u2014 an accusation Field now denies.\nFigma AI looks rather heavily trained on existing apps.\nThis is a \"weather app\" using the new Make Designs feature and the results are basically Apple's Weather app (left). Tried three times, same results. https://t.co/Ij20OpPCer pic.twitter.com/psFTV6daVD \u2014 Andy Allen (@asallen) July 1, 2024\nThe Make Design feature is available within Figma\u2019s software and will generate UI (user interface) layouts and components from text prompts. \u201cJust describe what you need, and the feature will provide you with a first draft,\u201d is how the company explained it when the feature launched.\nThe idea was that developers could use the feature to help get their ideas down quickly to begin exploring different design directions and then arrive at a solution faster, Figma said.\nThe feature was introduced at Figma\u2019s Config conference last week, where the company explained that it was not trained on Figma content, community files or app designs, Field notes in his response on X.\n\u201cIn other words, the accusations around data training in this tweet are false,\u201d he said.\nBut in its haste to launch new AI features to remain competitive, the quality assurance work that should accompany new additions seems to have been overlooked.\nMirroring complaints in other industries, some designers immediately argued that Figma\u2019s AI tools, like Make Design, would wipe out jobs by bringing digital design to the mass market, while others countered that AI would simply help to eliminate a lot of the repetitive work that went into design, allowing more interesting ideas to emerge.\nOr this will remove a lot of the repetitive work in design and raise the bar so new interesting ideas can emerge, just like new tooling always has\nCorps that don\u2019t invest in design still wont, and those that do will continue to do so. And the truth is there\u2019s usually so much\u2026 \u2014 Dustin Karp (@digitdustin) June 26, 2024\nAllen\u2019s discovery that Figma essentially seemed to be copying other apps led to increased concern among the design community.\n\u201cJust a heads up to any designers using the new Make Designs feature that you may want to thoroughly check existing apps or modify the results heavily so that you don\u2019t unknowingly land yourself in legal trouble,\u201d Allen warned others on X.\nField responded by clarifying that Make Design uses off-the-shelf large language models, combined with \u201csystems we commissioned to be used by these models.\u201d He said the problem with this approach is that the variability is too low.\n(4) I have asked our team to temporarily disable the Make Design feature until we are confident we can stand behind its output. The feature will be disabled when our US based team wakes up in a few hours, and we will re-enable it when we have completed a full QA pass on the\u2026 \u2014 Dylan Field (@zoink) July 2, 2024\n\u201cWithin hours of seeing [Allen\u2019s] tweet, we identified the issue, which was related to the underlying design systems that were created,\u201d Field wrote on X. \u201cUltimately it is my fault for not insisting on a better QA process for this work and pushing our team hard to hit a deadline for Config.\u201d\nApple was not immediately available for comment. Figma pointed to Field\u2019s tweets as its statement on the matter.\nField says Figma will temporarily disable the Make Design feature until the team is confident it can \u201cstand behind its output.\u201d The feature will be disabled as of Tuesday and will not be re-enabled until Figma has completed a full QA pass on the feature\u2019s underlying design system.\"\n\nResponse:",
