Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The tech giant also suggested it's seeing a return on investment from its expensive GPU-based servers.\nThe company's remarks on its earnings call eased investor worries that Nvidia's elevated AI sales were tied to an arms race among cloud providers that could be slowing down.\nMicrosoft's earnings report \"may encourage most Nvidia/semis investors, as Microsoft's capex came in much hotter-than-expected at $19 billion in the quarter,\" UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in a note on Wednesday.\nNvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the AI boom. Its stock has doubled so far in 2024 and is up more than 500% since ChatGPT's release in November 2022 kicked off intense investor interest in artificial intelligence technology.\nMorgan Stanley analysts named Nvidia a \"top pick\" in a note on Wednesday, saying that concerns including competitive dynamics, export controls and supply chain concerns are likely to \"fade with time.\"\n\"Our perception is that the market is taking a very glass half-empty view of some of the hyperscale comments, where there is a clear desire on the part of customers to continue to commit resources to developing multi modal generative AI,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote.\nMoore also highlighted that Nvidia's chips are transitioning from last-generation \"Hopper\" or H100 series chips to a new generation, called Blackwell, which could spur additional sales.\n\"Our checks generally show that customers want to deploy GPUs as quickly as possible, and the resilience of the H100 even a few weeks from Blackwell ramping to us makes those spending concerns seem premature,\" Moore wrote.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs posts $4.5 billion loss in second quarter\ndescription1:\nA visitor wears a virtual reality headset Meta Quest as he takes part in an immersive experience stand during the Viva Technology show at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on May 24, 2024 in Paris, France.\nMeta's ambitious plans to develop the metaverse is still costing the company billions of dollars a quarter.\nAs part of the company's second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Meta's Reality Labs unit, which houses augmented and virtual reality technologies, recorded an operating loss of $4.48 billion. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting a loss of $4.55 billion.\nSince late 2020, the Reality Labs unit has generated cumulative losses of about $50 billion, underscoring CEO Mark Zuckerberg's massive investments into the hardware and software that underpins what he says will be the next era of personal computing.\nRevenue in Reality Labs, largely derived from the company's Quest family of VR headsets and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, came in at $353 million, representing growth of 28% from $276 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the unit to bring in $371 million.\nIn September, Meta debuted the Quest 3 VR headset, which has a starting price of $499. A few months later, Apple released its Vision Pro VR and AR headset, which starts at $3,500. In June, CNBC reported that Apple started deliveries of its Vision Pro headset to China, where it has a retail price that starts at 29,999 yuan, or $4,128.\nWith the VR market remains nascent, Meta has been increasingly promoting its smart glasses, which it co-develops with Ray-Ban. Zuckerberg has pointed to advances in artificial intelligence and related large language models as improving the capabilities of smart glasses.\nEarlier in July, Francesco Milleri, the CEO of Ray-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica, told analysts that Meta plans to become a shareholder in the European eyewear maker, expanding on a previous partnership between the two companies dating back to 2020.\nMeta's second generation of smart glasses went on sale in October with a starting price of $299. Zuckerberg said in April during an earnings call with analysts that there can be a \"meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.\"\n\ntitle2:\nFounder behind social media app IRL charged with fraud\ndescription2:\nWhile venture capitalists and the rest of the technorati are off on holiday or attending the Paris Olympics, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff attorneys are keeping busy this summer.\nFor the second time this week \u2014 and at least the fourth time in the past several months \u2014 the SEC has charged a venture-backed founder on allegations of fraud.\nThe SEC said Wednesday it has charged Abraham Shafi, the founder and former CEO of the social media startup known as IRL, for allegedly defrauding investors. The agency says Shafi made false and misleading statements about the company\u2019s growth and concealed that he and his fianc\u00e9e, Barbara Woortmann, extensively used company credit cards to pay for personal expenses.\nIRL was positioned as a viral social media app that took off during the pandemic, but there was one small problem: Its millions of users were fake. IRL, which started as a social calendar app and was building out a messaging-based social network to become the \u201cWeChat of the West, shut down in June 2023 after an internal investigation by the company\u2019s board found that 95% of the app\u2019s users were \u201cautomated or from bots.\u201d\nBefore IRL\u2019s demise, Shafi had managed to raise $200 million in venture capital. The startup\u2019s last round \u2014 a Series C raise of $170 million led by Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund 2 \u2014 pushed IRL into unicorn status with a $1.17 billion valuation. Problems and concerns emerged not long after.\nThe SEC said in its complaint Wednesday that Shafi portrayed IRL as a viral social media platform that had organically attracted its purported 12 million users. Instead, IRL spent millions of dollars on ads that offered incentives to download the IRL app, according to the SEC.\nThe SEC alleges Shafi then hid those expenses. The complaint also alleges that Shafi didn\u2019t disclose to investors that he and Woortmann charged hundreds of thousands of dollars on the company\u2019s credit cards on clothing, home furnishings and travel.\n\u201cAs we alleged, Shafi took advantage of investors\u2019 appetite for investments in the pre-IPO technology space and fraudulently raised approximately $170 million by lying about IRL\u2019s business practices,\u201d said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office. \u201cInvestors in this space should continue to be vigilant.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the SEC charged BitClout founder Nader Al-Naji with fraud and unregistered offering of securities, claiming he used his pseudonymous online identity \u201cDiamondHands\u201d to avoid regulatory scrutiny while he raised over $257 million in cryptocurrency. BitClout, a buzzy crypto startup, was backed by high-profile VCs such as a16z, Sequoia, Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Winklevoss Capital.\nIn June, the SEC charged Ilit Raz, CEO and founder of the now-shuttered AI recruitment startup Joonko, with defrauding investors of at least $21 million. The agency alleged Raz made false and misleading statements about the quantity and quality of Joonko\u2019s customers, the number of candidates on its platform and the startup\u2019s revenue.\nThe agency has also gone after venture firms in recent months. In May, the SEC charged Robert Scott Murray and his firm Trillium Capital LLC with a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock price of Getty Images Holdings Inc. by announcing a phony offer by Trillium to purchase Getty Images.\n\ntitle3:\nBumble and Hinge allowed stalkers to pinpoint users\u2019 locations down to 2 meters, researchers say\ndescription3:\nA group of researchers said they found that vulnerabilities in the design of some dating apps, including the popular Bumble and Hinge, allowed malicious users or stalkers to pinpoint the location of their victims down to 2 meters.\nIn a new academic paper, researchers from the Belgian university KU Leuven detailed their findings when they analyzed 15 popular dating apps. Of those, Badoo, Bumble, Grindr, happn, Hinge and Hily all had the same vulnerability that could have helped a malicious user identify the near-exact location of another user, according to the researchers.\nWhile neither of those apps share exact locations when displaying the distance between users on their profiles, they did use exact locations for the \u201cfilters\u201d feature of the apps. Generally speaking, by using filters, users can tailor their search for a partner based on criteria like age, height, what type of relationship they are looking for and, crucially, distance.\nTo pinpoint the exact location of a target user, the researchers used a novel technique they call \u201coracle trilateration.\u201d In general, trilateration, which for example is used in GPS, works by using three points and measuring their distance relative to the target. This creates three circles, which intersect at the point where the target is located.\nOracle trilateration works slightly differently. The researchers wrote in their paper that the first step for the person who wants to identify their target\u2019s location \u201croughly estimates the victim\u2019s location,\u201d for example, based on the location displayed in the target\u2019s profile. Then the attacker moves in increments \u201cuntil the oracle indicates that the victim is no longer within proximity, and this for three different directions. The attacker now has three positions with a known exact distance, i.e., the preselected proximity distance, and can trilaterate the victim,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\u201cIt was somewhat surprising that known issues were still present in these popular apps,\u201d Karel Dhondt, one of the researchers, told TechCrunch. While this technique doesn\u2019t reveal the exact GPS coordinates of the victim, \u201cI\u2019d say 2 meters is close enough to pinpoint the user,\u201d Dhondt said.\nThe good news is that all the apps that had these issues, and that the researchers reached out to, have now changed how distance filters work and are not vulnerable to the oracle trilateration technique. The fix, according to the researchers, was to round up the exact coordinates by three decimals, making them less precise and accurate.\n\u201cThis is approximately an uncertainty of one kilometer,\u201d Dhondt said.\nBumble\u2019s vice president of global communications Gabrielle Ferree said that the company was \u201cmade aware of these findings in early 2023 and swiftly resolved the issues outlined.\u201d\nDmytro Kononov, CTO and co-founder of Hily, told TechCrunch in a statement that the company received a report on the vulnerability in May 2023 and then did an investigation to assess the researchers\u2019 claims.\n\u201cThe findings indicated a potential possibility for trilateration. However, in practice, exploiting this for attacks was impossible. This is due to our internal mechanisms designed to protect against spammers and the logic of our search algorithm,\u201d Kononov said. \u201cDespite this, we engaged in extensive consultations with the authors of the report and collaboratively developed new geocoding algorithms to completely eliminate this type of attack. These new algorithms have been successfully implemented for over a year now.\u201d\nNeither Badoo, which is owned by Bumble, nor Hinge responded to a request for comment.\nHappn CEO and president Karima Ben Abdelmalek told TechCrunch in an emailed statement that the company was contacted by the researchers last year.\n\u201cAfter review by our Chief Security Officer of the research findings, we had the opportunity to discuss the trilateration method with the researchers. However, happn has an additional layer of protection beyond just rounding distances,\u201d said Ben Abdelmalek. \u201cThis additional protection was not taken into account in their analysis and we mutually agreed that this extra measure on happn makes the trilateration technique ineffective.\u201d\nThe researchers also found that a malicious person could locate users of Grindr, another popular dating app, to around 111 meters of their exact coordinates. While this is better than the 2 meters that the other apps allowed, it could still be potentially dangerous, according to the researchers.\n\u201cWe argue that 111 meters, which is the corresponding distance that goes with this precision, is not sufficient in densely sparsely populated areas,\u201d said Dhondt.\nGrindr makes it impossible to go below 111 meters because it rounds users\u2019 precise locations by three decimals. And when they reached out to Grindr, the company said that this was a feature, not a bug, according to the researchers.\nKelly Peterson Miranda, chief privacy officer at Grindr, said in a statement that \u201cfor many of our users, Grindr is their only form of connection to the LGBTQ+ community, and the proximity Grindr offers to this community is paramount in providing the ability to interact with those closest to them.\u201d\n\u201cAs is the case with many location-based social networks and dating apps, Grindr requires certain location information in order to connect its users with those nearby,\u201d Miranda said, adding that users can disable their distance to be displayed if they want. \u201cGrindr users are in control of what location information they provide.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nStrong AI demand lifts profits\ndescription4:\nThe Samsung logo is on display at their pavilion during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on February 28, 2024. (Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nSamsung Electronics on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected second-quarter revenue and operating profit, as demand for its advanced memory chips that are crucial for artificial intelligence training remained strong.\nHere are Samsung's second-quarter results versus analysts' average estimates according to LSEG.\nRevenue: 74.07 trillion Korean won (about $53.45 billion) vs. 73.74 trillion Korean won\n74.07 trillion Korean won (about $53.45 billion) vs. 73.74 trillion Korean won Operating profit: 10.44 trillion Korean won vs 9.53 trillion Korean won\nSamsung's revenue for the quarter ended June jumped 23.42% from a year earlier, while operating profit soared 1,458.2%.\nThe South Korean giant said robust demand for high-bandwidth as well as conventional memory, such as regular dynamic random access memory, from customers expanding AI investments contributed to the strong performance.\nFor the second half, Samsung said it expects the demand from server AI to stay strong across server products including HBM, server DRAM and SSD. SSD, or solid-state drive, refers to a semiconductor-based storage device.\nThe firm added that expanding capacity to meet demand for HBM and server DRAM could further constrain supply of conventional memory chips.\nDuring its earnings call, the firm said it plans to address the AI demand by expanding sales of HBM3E \u2014the latest AI memory product \u2014 through capacity expansion in the second half.\nIt will also expand sales of SSDs which are currently in high demand for AI servers as well.\nThe firm also said it would pay out a dividend of 361 won per common and preferred share for the second quarter.\n\"According to our current dividend policy, the total amount distributed per quarter amounts to approximately 2.45 trillion won, which will be paid near the end of August.\"\nSamsung shares rose as much as 1.35% Wednesday morning.\"\n\nResponse:",
