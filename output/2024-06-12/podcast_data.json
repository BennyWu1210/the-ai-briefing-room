Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

That did not hold until the close, however, with Microsoft finishing ahead at the closing bell.\nInvestors, after digesting Apple's expansive plans for artificial intelligence across its family of devices, sent shares surging more than 7% to a record high on Tuesday. That enthusiasm continued into Wednesday's session with shares rising another 2.8%.\nApple announced it would weave generative AI technology across its native apps and its latest devices, with features ranging from writing-assistance technology to generative AI-generated emojis.\nMorgan Stanley, Evercore and Bank of America analysts said in notes to investors this week that Apple's new AI features, called Apple Intelligence, will drive users to buy new iPhones. \"Restricting Apple Intelligence to iPhones sold within the last year adds to our conviction that AI can help kick off an iPhone super cycle,\" Evercore analysts wrote.\nThere is a battle for the top. Microsoft had surpassed Apple's market cap earlier this year. Earlier this month, Nvidia passed Apple and briefly became the second-most valuable public U.S. company.\nMicrosoft is also likely to be a beneficiary of Apple's AI ambitions. The iPhone maker announced that it would include OpenAI's large-language models as an available feature for its users, with other models to come over time. Microsoft is one of OpenAI's largest investors, and its Azure cloud services have seen recent growth fueled by the widespread adoption of OpenAI's models.\n\ntitle1:\nOracle stock pops 13% on AI demand, new deals with Google and OpenAI\ndescription1:\nOracle Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison delivers a keynote address during the 2019 Oracle OpenWorld in San Francisco on Sept. 16, 2019.\nOracle shares closed up more than 13% on Wednesday, a day after the software company announced its fourth-quarter results and cloud deals with Microsoft -backed OpenAI and Google . Wednesday's close marked the stock's best day since Dec. 10, 2021.\nThe company reported $14.29 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 3% year over year and shy of the $14.55 billion expected by analysts according to LSEG. Oracle's adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.63, while analysts expected $1.65.\nOracle also reported $98 billion of remaining performance obligations, or RPO, in the fourth quarter, which is a figure that represents the revenue that the company expects to receive from contracts in future quarters. CEO Safra Catz said the company signed large sales contracts over the third and fourth quarters primarily driven by demand to use Oracle's cloud to train artificial intelligence models, according to a release.\nAlongside its results, Oracle said it is partnering with Microsoft and OpenAI to help supply additional computing capacity for the startup. Oracle also announced it is bringing its database to Google Cloud.\nAnalysts from Citi said Oracle's sluggish revenue for the fourth quarter was offset by \"tremendous RPO bookings growth.\" They said it is hard to ignore a $98 billion outstanding backlog, but they would like to see better signs of how it will convert directly to revenue.\n\"Stepping back, we see results as mixed,\" the analysts wrote in a note Tuesday.\nUBS analysts said the highlight of Oracle's results is its \"extraordinary sequential backlog growth of $18 billion.\" They note that the company missed some \"key\" metrics, but they agree with another investor who said this quarter's results reflect more of a narrative story than a numbers story.\n\"The AI narrative is powerful enough to lift sentiment,\" they said in a note Wednesday.\nUBS reiterated its buy rating on the stock.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said Oracle's quarter was mixed, but the \"near term AI build-out likely wins the day and sustains momentum in shares.\" Even so, they said they still have longer-term questions about the nature of the contracts Oracle is booking, and what the gross margin implications will be.\n\"As investors look to vendors participating in the build-out of GenAI infrastructure, these impressive bookings and the addition of a marquee customer like OpenAI likely puts Oracle more firmly on the radar screen,\" the analysts wrote in a note Wednesday.\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.\n\ntitle2:\nBroadcom beats earnings estimates, announces 10-for-1 stock split\ndescription2:\nBroadcom posted earnings for the second fiscal quarter on Wednesday that beat analysts' estimates. It also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, set to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 15.\nThe stock rose about 10% in extended trading.\nHere is how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended in May:\nEarnings per share : $10.96 adjusted vs. $10.84 expected\n: $10.96 adjusted vs. $10.84 expected Revenue: $12.49 billion vs. $12.03 billion expected\nThe chipmaker expects about $51 billion in sales during its fiscal 2024 year, an increase over the company's previous forecast, and slightly higher than consensus expectations of $50.42 billion.\nBroadcom reported $2.12 billion in net income during the quarter, or $4.42 per share, versus $3.48 billion in net income, or $8.15 per share, in the year-ago period.\nBroadcom is one of the chipmakers benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom because its devices can run the sorts of AI applications that have enamored the tech industry. Broadcom said $3.1 billion in sales during the quarter could be attributed to revenue from AI products. For example, Broadcom works with Google , which partially designs its own AI chip called a TPU.\n\"Talking of AI accelerators, you may know our hyperscale customers are accelerating their investments to scale up the performance of these clusters,\" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on the earnings call. \"And to that end, we have just been awarded the next-generation custom AI accelerators for these hyperscale customers of ours.\"\nThe company also said revenue from VMware, an enterprise software company it acquired for $69 billion late last year, contributed to its sales growth and forecast for the rest of the year.\nThe company's overall revenue was up 43% on an annual basis during the quarter. Without VMware sales, it would have been up 12% on a year-over-year basis, Broadcom said.\nCorrection: The consensus estimate was $12.03 billion. An earlier version misstated the figure.\n\ntitle3:\nFintech Brex abandons co-CEO model, talks IPO, cash burn and plans for a secondary sale\ndescription3:\nSince fintech startup Brex\u2019s inception in 2017, its two co-founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi have run the company as co-CEOs.\nBut starting today, the pair told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview, the San Francisco-based corporate credit card and expense management company is shifting to a more traditional \u2014 and what they say should be a more agile \u2014 model of just one CEO at the helm. Franceschi will become the sole CEO while Dubugras will become chairman of Brex\u2019s board.\nIn an in-depth conversation, the two co-founders gave us a peek into what the new structure will look like, the company\u2019s current state of finances and how it has managed to reduce its cash burn.\nThe close friends started working together as co-founders of another company, Brazilian payment processing startup Pagar.me, in 2012 at the wee age of 16. (That company ended up getting acquired by Stone Pagamentos for \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d \u2014 before the two had even gone to college.) While both founders could code, they quickly realized that Franceschi was the \u201cbetter coder.\u201d Rather than having one person manage a part of the organization like product and engineering and the other one manage sales and marketing, they decided to split their duties as external and internal co-CEOs (a decision they touched on in this episode of the Found podcast last year).\nThe model worked so well at that company, they said, that they decided to employ the same strategy when they founded Brex after dropping out of Stanford to participate in the YC Winter 2017 cohort.\n\u201cThe upside is that we had twice as much time as other CEOs,\u201d said Dubugras.\nBut now the co-founders believe that having two CEOs could be a bottleneck to the company\u2019s growth by keeping its leadership from making faster decisions. They also feel like when they eventually do go public \u2014 something they don\u2019t anticipate doing until 2025 or later \u2014 that investors will be more attracted to a traditional model of just one CEO running the company.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a scale where we\u2019re starting to see some of the cracks in the co-CEO model,\u201d Dubugras told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. \u201cAfter talking, we thought this would help the business succeed. We thought this would enable much faster and better decision-making.\u201d\nImage Credits: Brex\nOver the years at Brex, Franceschi led the development of the company\u2019s core financial infrastructure from scratch, which the pair claim allowed Brex \u201cto have great margins and expand faster globally.\u201d He, according to the company, \u201cled the entire organization over the last six years,\u201d helping it grow to more than 30,000 customers (from startups to over 130 publicly traded companies) and a product suite that spans corporate cards, banking, expense management, travel and bill pay. Some of its larger customers include DoorDash, Flexport, Roblox, Compass and Shein, but the bulk of its revenue still comes from startups, the co-founders say.\nMeanwhile, Dubugras focused more on tasks such as fundraising \u2014 the startup has brought in over $1.5 billion in both primary and secondary transactions; its backers include Greenoaks Capital, TCV, Tiger Global Management, Kleiner Perkins, Y Combinator and Global Founders Capital, among others. He also managed relationships with banking partners and regulators and served as the face of Brex \u201cpersonally selling\u201d to its largest customer \u201cat any moment in time.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cEach of us had our own responsibilities \u2026 [and] we made many decisions together. This worked extremely well when we were smaller, but naturally became harder as we grew.\u201d\nDubugras insists he\u2019s still committed to Brex.\n\u201cI\u2019ll still be involved to the extent that the team wants and needs me involved. Brex remains my main and only thing,\u201d he said.\nUps and downs\nThe once high-flying company has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Two years ago, it was valued at $12.3 billion after raising $300 million and had poached former Meta exec Karandeep Anand to serve as its chief product officer after having led Meta\u2019s business products group. (He was then named the first president of the company in November of 2023.)\nIn January, Brex laid off 282 people, or about 20% of its staff. That was after an October 2022 layoff of 136 people, or 11% of its staff, across all departments as part of a restructuring. Today, it has 1,000 workers.\nThere\u2019s also been a lot of shuffling among Brex\u2019s management. Sam Blond left his role as chief revenue officer in 2022 to join Founders Fund (a position he departed in March). Earlier this year, Brex announced that its COO, Michael Tannenbaum, was transitioning from his role to become a board member. At that time, Camilla Morais, who was SVP of global operations, was promoted to COO. And it was announced that Cosmin Nicolaescu was transitioning from his role as CTO to an adviser position this summer.\nIn the note to employees at the time of its layoffs, Franceschi wrote that the company was now \u201cemphasizing long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains\u201d in its comp structure.\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of its finances.\nThe co-founders told TechCrunch that its cash runway is now four years. This counters a January article from The Information around the time of its most recent layoffs wherein Brex reportedly told employees that it burned $17 million a month in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that it only had \u201cenough cash to last through March 2026.\u201d When asked about financials at the time of those layoffs, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the data was \u201cinaccurate\u201d and directed me to the note announcing the layoffs and wrote: \u201cThe changes today are driven by a desire to make Brex more agile and accelerate our path to profitability, building on the growth we had in 2023. We grew our revenue 35%+ in 2023 while gross profit increased by 75%. This reduction in force puts us on a clear path towards profitability.\u201d\nOf course, laying off workers is a tried-and-true way to reduce spending and improve cash runway.\nToday, Franceschi told TechCrunch that Brex has cut its cash burn in half over the past year. And while he declined to reveal any revenue figures, he said the company\u2019s goal is to be cash-flow positive by 2025.\nWhen asked how the fintech startup had managed to reduce its cash burn, he said there was a combination of factors. For one, Brex has seen increased revenue growth \u201cwithout increasing fixed costs,\u201d he said.\nThe layoffs from earlier this year \u201ccontributed to a lot of the savings\u201d (and he says he doesn\u2019t anticipate any more layoffs). And lastly, the company has worked harder to move faster.\n\u201cThe biggest benefit after the layoff was not just the cost savings. It was the way in which the company operates,\u201d he said.\nWhen it comes to revenue, Franceschi said that it\u2019s mostly from interchange, although its software business is growing as startups grow larger and new mid-market and enterprise companies sign on as customers. And there is also the revenue derived from interest and foreign exchange fees.\nFranceschi said that by offering cash back and rewards, more of its customers are using Brex\u2019s card product, which is in turn generating more interchange revenue.\nMeanwhile, Brex doesn\u2019t have any plans to do any primary fundraising anytime soon. But it may offer a secondary sale at some point so that before the company goes public, those shareholders who want to cash in can do so without dragging down the stock, Dubugras said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a high-volatility public company \u2026 [T]hat really distracts from the execution of the company and the core mission,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that one important piece for having a lower volatility public company is being cash-flow positive and making money, which is something that we historically have planned for 2025. So, if that happens in 2025, [an IPO] will be soon after. But we need to get there first.\u201d\nNo doubt that the expense management space in which Brex operates is an increasingly crowded one \u2014 in that it competes with startups such as Ramp, Mercury and Airbase, among others. But it also competes with the likes of American Express, Concur and Citi.\nFranceschi claims that Brex\u2019s advantage is that it built its tech stack \u201cvertically integrated down to the Mastercard rails and the ACH rails and the money movement rails,\u201d whereas some competitors built their business on top of other platforms such as Stripe or Marqeta.\nThat works for more simple use cases, he said. But for more complex scenarios such as global coverage, depth of integration helps.\nStill, the competitive landscape remains heated. In April, Ramp announced it had raised another $150 million at a post-money valuation of $7.65 billion. And digital banking startup Mercury in May announced it is layering software onto its bank accounts, giving its business customers the ability to pay bills, invoice customers and reimburse employees.\nBrex remains undeterred.\n\u201cA lot of the momentum that we\u2019re seeing now is net new customers coming in on the enterprise side, versus customers at scale with us naturally,\u201d Franceschi said.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

Given the frequency with which their developers toss around the phrase \u201cgeneral purpose humanoids,\u201d more attention ought to be paid to the first bit. After decades of single-purpose systems, the jump to more generalized systems will be a big one. We\u2019re just not there yet.\nThe push to produce a robotic intelligence that can fully leverage the wide breadth of movements opened up by bipedal humanoid design has been a key topic for researchers. The use of generative AI in robotics has been a white-hot subject recently, as well. New research out of MIT points to how the latter might profoundly affect the former.\nOne of the biggest challenges on the road to general-purpose systems is training. We have a solid grasp on best practices for training humans how to do different jobs. The approaches to robotics, while promising, are fragmented. There are a lot of promising methods, including reinforcement and imitation learning, but future solutions will likely involve combinations of these methods, augmented by generative AI models.\nOne of the prime use cases suggested by the MIT team is the ability to collate relevant information from these small, task-specific datasets. The method has been dubbed policy composition (PoCo). Tasks include useful robot actions like pounding in a nail and flipping things with a spatula.\n\u201c[Researchers] train a separate diffusion model to learn a strategy, or policy, for completing one task using one specific dataset,\u201d the school notes. \u201cThen they combine the policies learned by the diffusion models into a general policy that enables a robot to perform multiple tasks in various settings.\u201d\nPer MIT, the incorporation of diffusion models improved task performance by 20%. That includes the ability to execute tasks that require multiple tools, as well as learning/adapting to unfamiliar tasks. The system is able to combine pertinent information from different datasets into a chain of actions required to execute a task.\n\u201cOne of the benefits of this approach is that we can combine policies to get the best of both worlds,\u201d says the paper\u2019s lead author, Lirui Wang. \u201cFor instance, a policy trained on real-world data might be able to achieve more dexterity, while a policy trained on simulation might be able to achieve more generalization.\u201d\nThe goal of this specific work is the creation of intelligence systems that allow robots to swap different tools to perform different tasks. The proliferation of multi-purpose systems would take the industry a step closer to general-purpose dream.\"\n\nResponse:",
