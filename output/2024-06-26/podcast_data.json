The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

However, NASA clarified that the vehicle will be different from SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule, which delivers cargo and crew to the station, and other vehicles that perform services for the agency. Unlike these vehicles, which are built and operated by SpaceX, NASA will take ownership of the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle post-development and operate it throughout its mission.\nBoth the vehicle and the ISS will destructively break up as they reenter the atmosphere, and one of the big tasks ahead for SpaceX is to ensure that the station reenters in a way that endangers no populated areas.\nThe launch contract for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be announced separately.\nNASA and its partners had been evaluating using a Russian Roscosmos Progress spacecraft to conduct the de-orbit mission, but studies indicated that a new spacecraft was needed for the de-orbit maneuver. The station\u2019s safe demise is a responsibility shared by the five space agencies that operate on the ISS \u2014 NASA, the Canadian Space Agency, European Space Agency, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and State Space Corporation Roscosmos \u2014 but it is unclear whether this contract amount is being paid out by all countries.\nTechCrunch has contacted NASA for more details and we will update this post if we hear back.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon reaches $2 trillion market cap for the first time\ndescription1:\nAmazon shares closed up 3.9% to $193.61 on Wednesday, pushing the company's market cap past $2 trillion for the first time.\nIn crossing the milestone, Amazon joins Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet and Microsoft , all of which are worth $2 trillion or more. Investors have piled into tech stocks recently as excitement around generative artificial intelligence has reached a fever pitch. Nvidia, which makes graphics processors for the servers that power large AI models, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries, with its market value soaring from $2 trillion to $3 trillion in just over three months.\nShares of Amazon have surged 27.5% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen about 18% over the same period.\nIn April, the company reported first-quarter earnings that showed its Amazon Web Services business was continuing to rebound from a recent slowdown caused by businesses that trimmed their cloud spend. Amazon executives also spoke at length about how AWS can benefit from a surge in demand for generative AI services.\nInvestors have also cheered the company's recent cost-cutting initiatives, which fueled Amazon's earnings growth in recent quarters. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a multiyear quest to reign in the company's spending, including widespread layoffs that have affected more than 27,000 Amazon employees.\nIt took Amazon more than four years to cross the $2 trillion milestone. Its market cap reached $1 trillion in 2020, the second time in its history after hitting the benchmark for the first time in 2018.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia CEO speaks at first shareholder meeting since stock surge\ndescription2:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday that the company's advantage in artificial intelligence chips was due to a bet it made more than 10 years ago, centering on billions of dollars in AI investment and a team of thousands of engineers.\nHuang's comments came during the Q&A period of Nvidia's shareholder meeting following a more than 200% surge in the stock over the past year. Wall Street has been enamored by the company's dominant position in the AI chip market.\nNvidia recently split its stock 10-for-1, passed a $3 trillion valuation and briefly reached the status of most valuable public company.\nThe first question Huang answered Wednesday was about the company's competition, as traditional chipmakers and startups alike release products intended to challenge Nvidia's more than 80% market share in AI chips.\nNvidia shares fell more than 1% in trading on Wednesday.\nWithout naming competitors, Huang laid out the company's overall strategy to maintain its position, leading with the idea that Nvidia has already \"transformed\" into a data center-focused company from its previous gaming focus. The company is also looking to create new markets for its AI, such as in industrial robotics, and it aims to partner with every computer maker and cloud provider to do so.\nHuang said its AI chips provide the \"lowest total cost of ownership,\" suggesting that while other chips may be less expensive, Nvidia's are more economical considering their performance and cost to run.\nUltimately, Huang said Nvidia had achieved a \"virtuous circle,\" a term in the technology industry that refers to when a platform has the most users, which allows it to make the improvements it needs to attract even more users.\n\"The NVIDIA platform is broadly available through every major cloud provider and computer maker, creating a large and attractive install base for developers and customers, which makes our platform more valuable to our customers,\" Huang said.\nNvidia shareholders were pleased with the company's performance and approved a nonbinding vote on executive compensation called \"say on pay.\" Nvidia executives are paid in a combination of salary and various kinds of restricted stock units.\nHuang received a compensation package worth about $34 million during the company's 2024 fiscal year, a 60% increase since 2023, according to the company's annual filing.\n\ntitle3:\nApple expands its self-service repair program to Europe\ndescription3:\nApple announced on Thursday that its self-service repair program is now available in Europe.\nThe program, dubbed Apple Diagnostics for Self Service Repair, gives consumers the ability to test products for optimal parts functionality and identify parts that may need repair without assistance from Apple or an independent repair provider.\nFirst launched in the U.S. in December 2023, the tool now supports 42 Apple products and is available in 32 European countries, including the U.K., France and Germany, according to a release. The program will now support iPhone, Mac and Studio Display models in 33 countries and 24 languages. Apple said it also plans to expand the service to Canada in 2025.\nApple first launched the self-service program in 2022, offering customers access to manuals, legitimate Apple parts and tools used by Apple to allow them to repair their own devices. The program was started in response to pressure from \"right to repair\" advocates who argue that consumers should not be locked into a select set of authorized repair shops. In February, the company expanded the program to include Mac models powered by the latest M3 chip.\nThe company said the self-service repair tool is part of an ongoing effort to extend the lifespan of its products.\n\"While Apple is committed to providing safe and affordable repair options, designing and building long-lasting products remains the top priority,\" Apple said in the announcement. \"The best type of repair for customers and the planet is one that is never needed.\"\nCustomers can begin an Apple Diagnostics session on a second product to check the status and performance on a device that may need repair, according to a release. After following a series of onscreen prompts, they will learn whether their product needs repairing and which parts may need to be replaced.\n\ntitle4:\nPrince Constantijn\ndescription4:\nPrince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator. Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. \"Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,\" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. \"We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,\" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.\nThe bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose \"systemic risk,\" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any \"serious incidents.\" Prince Constantijn said he's \"really concerned\" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. \"It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,\" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. \"But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space.\" \"There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops.\" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.\nwatch now\nThe bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it \"quite hard\" for itself to innovate in AI due to \"big restrictions on data,\" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is \"a much bigger and unified market\" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, \"Europe scores quite poorly.\" \"Where we score well is, I think, on talent,\" he said. \"We score well on technology itself.\" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, \"Europe is definitely going to be competitive,\" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that \"the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.\"\"\n\nResponse:",
