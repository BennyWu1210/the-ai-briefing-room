The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

David Swanson | Reuters\nElon Musk says he can grow Tesla into \"a leader in AI & robotics,\" an ambition that he's said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure. On Tesla's first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s \u2014 Nvidia's flagship artificial intelligence chip \u2014 from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year \"in combined training and inference AI.\" But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla's procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Tesla shares slipped as much as 1% on the news Tuesday morning. By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker's receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. \"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December said. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\" A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk's comment on the first-quarter Tesla call \"conflicts with bookings\" and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also \"conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.\" The email referenced news about Tesla's ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that head-count reductions could cause further delays with an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory. The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital. A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023. X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, \"X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.\" Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot Grok, CNBC has learned. Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with \"a rebellious streak\" and a would-be competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI services. While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk's \"antics\" and \"political rants.\" Tesla's stock price is down 29% this year.\nwatch now\nRather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he's been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network. \"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\" Musk said on the April earnings call. \"We will, and we are.\" To get there, he's said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia's GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google , Amazon , Meta , Microsoft , OpenAI and others.\n'Consuming every GPU that's out there'\nNvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it's hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers \"are consuming every GPU that's out there,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth. Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to \"allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,\" adding \"why allocate something when the data center's not ready?\" In naming customers that are already using Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, March 19, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nMusk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies. At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million \"Dojo\" supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a \"super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster\" at the company's factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles. At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build \"the world's largest GPU cluster\" in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February. The memo described a \"Musk mandate\" to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI's Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity. The Information previously reported some details of xAI's data center ambitions. On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk's Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn't disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.\nConflicts of interest\nWhile Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he'd want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction. \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,\" he said in the post. Tesla's latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company's outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal. If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he \"would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" He's already doing that at xAI. Musk's comments in the January post rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company's largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki's Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as \"blackmail.\" Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent. \"When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,\" Fleming said. \"If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.\" Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain. \"That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,\" Fleming said. Musk hasn't been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies. For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once. At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup. A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder. However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia's technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics. In a post on X following publication of this story, Musk wrote, \"Tesla had no place to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on, so they would have just sat in the warehouse.\" He said the \"south extension\" of the Texas Gigafactory will soon \"house 50k H100s\" for training of self-driving technology. Musk later added that, of Tesla's $10 billion in \"AI-related expenditures\" this year, $3 billion to $4 billion will go to purchasing Nvidia hardware. WATCH: Musk ordered Nvidia to ship thousands of AI chips to X\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI open letter warns of AI's 'serious risks' and lack of oversight\ndescription1:\nA group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter Tuesday describing concerns about the artificial intelligence industry's rapid advancement despite a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.\n\"AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" the employees wrote.\nOpenAI, Google , Microsoft , Meta and other companies are at the helm of a generative AI arms race \u2014 a market that is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade \u2014 as companies in seemingly every industry rush to add AI-powered chatbots and agents to avoid being left behind by competitors.\nThe current and former employees wrote that AI companies have \"substantial non-public information\" about what their technology can do, the extent of the safety measures they've put in place and the risk levels that technology has for different types of harm.\n\"We also understand the serious risks posed by these technologies,\" they wrote, adding that the companies \"currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\"\nThe letter also details the current and former employees' concerns about insufficient whistleblower protections for the AI industry, saying that without effective government oversight, employees are in a relatively unique position to hold companies accountable.\n\"Broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues,\" the signatories wrote. \"Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated.\"\nThe letter asks AI companies to commit to not entering or enforcing non-disparagement agreements; to create anonymous processes for current and former employees to voice concerns to a company's board, regulators and others; to support a culture of open criticism; and to not retaliate against public whistleblowing if internal reporting processes fail.\nFour anonymous OpenAI employees and seven former ones, including Daniel Kokotajlo, Jacob Hilton, William Saunders, Carroll Wainwright and Daniel Ziegler, signed the letter. Signatories also included Ramana Kumar, who formerly worked at Google DeepMind, and Neel Nanda, who currently works at Google DeepMind and formerly worked at Anthropic. Three famed computer scientists known for advancing the artificial intelligence field also endorsed the letter: Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC: \"We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we'll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.\" The company, which is backed by Microsoft , has an anonymous integrity hotline, as well as a Safety and Security Committee led by members of the board and OpenAI leaders, the spokesperson said.\nMicrosoft declined to comment.\n\ntitle2:\nWhat to expect from WWDC 2024: iOS 18, macOS 15 and so much AI\ndescription2:\nApple\u2019s annual World Wide Developer Conference kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET with the standard Tim Cook keynote. Whereas last year\u2019s WWDC will be remembered as the event that finally introduced the world to the Vision Pro, the company is hoping to make next week\u2019s event even more memorable as it finally spells out its generative AI plans.\nYou\u2019ll find information on how to stream the event live over here.\nWWDC\u2019s opening salvo is different from other Apple keynotes, in that it\u2019s the kickoff to a weeklong online and in-person event, running from June 10 to 14. While the company began opening things up more to the public during the pandemic, it\u2019s important to remember the reason for the season: Much like Google I/O and Microsoft Build before it, the true purpose for the event is showcasing the latest updates for developers.\nL-R: Space Black MacBook Pro, Space Gray Touchbar MacBook Pro Image Credits: Brian Heater\nWhile the last few years have showcased key hardware updates, owing to developments in Mac silicon and last year\u2019s headset preview, WWDC is not a hardware event. In fact, the latest buzzing from the rumor mill points to a keynote presentation that\u2019s very light on the hardware. Bloomberg is now even suggesting the event will be entirely devoid of new hardware.\nKeep in mind, Apple made a unusual choice of hosting a standalone virtual iPad event almost exactly a month prior to WWDC. The May 7 program debuted new versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Much to the chagrin of many, AI didn\u2019t play a major role in the event. After all of the fanfare around models like GPT and the big fuss Google has been making around Gemini integration in Android, Apple needs to come out swinging next week.\nThat said, the new M4 chip did just debut on the iPad. MacBooks featuring the chip and its more powerful siblings can\u2019t be too far away. Nor can the upcoming iPhone A18 chip, which the company will almost certainly claim is \u201cthe most advanced smartphone chip for AI\u201d or something equivalent.\nAI everything\nImage Credits: Apple\nConcern that Apple has fallen behind on gen AI has been enough to prompt Cook to promise big things on shareholder calls. In fact, the CEO made the decision to comment on future plans. In May, he promised that the company would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d on generative AI, adding, \u201cWe believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users.\u201d\nWill Apple\u2019s bid to break new ground be, in fact, groundbreaking? I anticipate it will be big on promises for developers, highlighting how generative AI will affect future versions of the company\u2019s various operating systems \u2014 with a focus on iOS. Rumors around Apple\u2019s approach to the world of large language models have been swirling around for some time now.\nEarly reports suggested the company was meeting with Google about potential Gemini integration for iOS. That would be a huge win for Google, with the model playing a key role in two operating systems that account for a combined 96% of the global mobile operating system market. More recent reporting, however, has pointed to a partnership with OpenAI. Much like I/O before it, I would anticipate being sick and tired all the AI talk by the time the company is finished.\nFollowing the collapse of its electric car project, Apple reportedly shuffled a number of employees into its internal generative AI efforts. Given how fresh that news is, it\u2019s safe to say that the company is still trailing the competition there. With that in mind, I anticipate that a lot of the AI-related news will come off the back of its OpenAI deal.\niOS 18 with more AI\nImage Credits: Darrell Etherington\nAlong with that partnership, expect iOS 18 to be the centerpiece of the event. There\u2019s a lot riding on what is reportedly \u201cone of the biggest iOS updates \u2014 if not the biggest \u2014 in the company\u2019s history.\u201d It\u2019s going to be so big, in fact, that Sarah took time out of her busy schedule to collate the rumored updates. I don\u2019t want to repeat her work, so I\u2019m going to distill some of the rumors here. Go read her story for more.\nSiri will be getting a long-awaited refresh, courtesy of Apple\u2019s generative AI work. The update will make the smart assistant more capable with the ability to directly edit photos, delete emails and other daily tasks. The update is also said to be bring an improved voice, notification summaries and an advanced version of Siri for Apple Watch.\nAI will also be infiltrating the Safari browser for more intelligent search, Notes for summarization and Voice Memos for transcriptions (something Google has touted for some time now).\nGenerative AI is even coming to emojis, allowing users to customize and create their own in Messages.\nApple is also said to be loosening up layout restrictions so users can place icons and widgets wherever they want on their homescreen.\nApple announced that RCS (Rich Communication Services) is coming to Messages, to make Android users feel slightly less bad \u2014 still green bubble, mind. Reports suggested it would arrive last fall, but that ship has obviously sailed. This coming fall, on the other hand, seems like a fine bet, especially with the whole DOJ thing looming.\nmacOS 15 debut\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nEvery time Tim Cook says \u201cAI,\u201d an investor gets their wings. While iOS is undoubtedly going to be the big operating system focus, Apple\u2019s still got news in the works for desktop. We\u2019ll be getting the official name for macOS 15. What\u2019s the most AI California place name? Alameda? Alcatraz? RodAI Drive?\nA lot of the iOS updates should also make their way to macOS, including those in Siri, Notes and Safari. Apple\u2019s office apps are said to be getting a gen AI boost, as well. That includes assistance in Pages, Keynote and developer environment app Xcode.\nSystem Settings will be continuing Apple\u2019s longstanding project of turning macOS into iOS, with a design refresh. Apple should be overhauling some key accessibility features, as well.

ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity all went down at the same time\ndescription3:\nAfter a multi-hour outage that took place in the early hours of the morning, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot went down again \u2014 but this time, it wasn\u2019t the only AI provider affected. On Tuesday morning, both Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Perplexity began seeing issues, too, but these were more quickly resolved.\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini appears to be operating at present, though it may have also briefly gone offline, according to some user reports.\nIt\u2019s unusual for three major AI providers to all be down at the same time, which could signal a broader infrastructure issue or internet-scale problem, such as those that affect multiple social media sites simultaneously, for example. It\u2019s also possible that Claude and Perplexity\u2019s issues were not due to bugs or other issues, but from receiving too much traffic in a short period of time due to ChatGPT\u2019s outage.\nOn ChatGPT\u2019s landing page, the ability to message the AI chatbot was not working during its outage. The issue began around 7:33 AM PT and resolved around 10:17 AM PT \u2014 another multi-hour outage.\nImage Credits: OpenAI/ChatGPT landing page down\nAt one point during the outage, ChatGPT\u2019s website was updated to indicate the service was at capacity \u2014 in pirate speak, no less \u2014 and offered to notify users when it was back online.\nImage Credits: OpenAI/capacity message\nClaude\u2019s website had been displaying an error with a message that reads: \u201cAn error occurred in the Server Components render. The specific message is omitted in production builds to avoid leaking sensitive details. A digest property is included on this error instance which may provide additional details about the nature of the error.\u201d\nThe site then advises to \u201ctry again.\u201d\nClaude started working again sometime after 12:10 p.m. ET.\nImage Credits: Anthropic/Claude down\nPerplexity\u2019s site was also serving the over-capacity message that would appear when the service receives too many requests. It said \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of questions right now and have reached our capacity. Please come back soon.\u201d\nThe site resumed functioning around the time that Claude\u2019s outage was resolved but has been intermittently up and down since.\nImage Credits: Perplexity / outage\nOf note, ChatGPT had only recently resolved a lengthy outage that affected its service overnight. The chatbot had been down for users around the world during the early morning hours (Pacific Time), leading to complaints across X and Threads. The company\u2019s status page signaled a bug was being fixed and the issue was being monitored around 12:21 a.m. PT.\nAs of 7:33 a.m. PT, the status page has been updated to say that ChatGPT is once again unavailable for some users and that OpenAI is \u201ccurrently investigating this issue.\u201d The chatbot was still down as of 12:28 p.m. ET, per its status page, which has flagged it as a \u201cmajor outage.\u201d The issues were fixed several hours later.\nImage Credits: OpenAI status page\nChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity \u2014 three totally different AI services \u2014 are all down right now.\nWhat the actual F is going on? pic.twitter.com/dUkVhSehGG \u2014 Benjamin De Kraker \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f (@BenjaminDEKR) June 4, 2024\nThe AI providers did not immediately return requests for comment or more information on the outages, but we\u2019ll update as more information becomes available.\nyou\u2019re laughing? chatgpt, claude and perplexity are all down at the same time and you\u2019re laughing? pic.twitter.com/06PIS0lAv3 \u2014 sophie (@netcapgirl) June 4, 2024\nThe AI outages are not the only online disruptions occurring at present.

Photographer: I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nU.S. chipmaker Intel on Tuesday announced new artificial intelligence chips for data centers, as it looks to take on rivals Nvidia and AMD , which have showcased upcoming chips in the last two days.\nIntel's Xeon 6 processor will deliver better performance and power efficiency for high-intensity data center workloads as compared with its predecessor, CEO Pat Gelsinger said during the Computex tech conference in Taiwan.\nThe announcement comes as rivals Nvidia and AMD launched new AI chips on Sunday and Monday, respectively, as they jostle for leadership in the booming industry.\nIt also comes six months after Intel launched its 5th Gen Intel Xeon processors for data center workloads and two months after announcing the Gaudi 3 processor for AI model training and deployment.\nIntel on Tuesday also revealed that prices for the Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators are lower than that of rival chips.\n\"Customers are looking for high performance, cost-effective gen AI training and inferencing solutions. And they've started to turn to alternatives like Gaudi. They want choice. They want open software and hardware solutions and time to market solutions at dramatically lower TCOs [total cost of ownership],\" Gelsinger said.\nIntel also revealed architecture details for its upcoming Lunar Lake processors \"to continue to grow the AI PC category.\" The Lunar Lake chips, expected to ship in the third quarter, will compete against Nvidia's and AMD's chips that are specifically designed for AI PCs.\nIntel is trying to catch up to Nvidia and AMD, after having largely been on the sidelines of the AI frenzy which saw tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and Google buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible.\"\n\nResponse:",
