Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Those tiles are designed to protect the second stage (which is also called Starship) from the extreme temperatures experienced when reentering Earth\u2019s atmosphere. One of the biggest issues, Musk suggested, is the vulnerability of the system overall: \u201cwe are not resilient to loss of a single tile in most places,\u201d he said. That means a single damaged or faulty tile could lead to catastrophe.\nAs Musk noted in his post, surviving reentry is just one part of the puzzle. The company will also need to establish an \u201centirely new supply chain\u201d for the high-performance heat shield tiles, and manufacture them at a very high volume.\nIt\u2019s a tough problem, but solving it would move them closer to the holy grail of launch vehicles: full reusability. SpaceX made major headway in reusability with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket \u2014 which has flown 56 times so far this year alone \u2014 but although the company recovers the booster, the second stage is expended in its target orbit. By reusing both stages of the rocket, SpaceX is hoping to drive down costs to a fraction of what they are today, all while delivering many orders of magnitude more mass to orbit in a single launch. (SpaceX\u2019s Transporter rideshare missions cost $6,000 per kilogram.)\nIf all goes to plan, the company will demonstrate the ability to return Starship to Earth via a controlled reentry and a soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX is also aiming to return the booster, called Super Heavy, also via ocean splashdown. And it will get one step closer to bringing the largest and most powerful launch system ever built online, ready to transport cargo and eventually crew to Earth\u2019s orbit and beyond.\nThis next Starship launch will be the fourth in a series of orbital flight tests that kicked off last April. Before the launch can move ahead, SpaceX must receive a commercial launch license from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the agency responsible for regulating commercial launch operations. The FAA also oversees investigations into rocket launches that go awry for any reason, and so it\u2019s been working closely with SpaceX throughout the Starship test campaign.\nAnd the previous Starship launches have certainly gone awry: The first two ended in fiery mid-air explosions, and the third concluded when both Super Heavy and Starship likely disintegrated before hitting the ocean. But for SpaceX, which takes an iterative approach to hardware development, each test was ultimately a success because they furnished engineers with data on the rocket in a real-world flight environment. And it\u2019s true that each mission has gone farther than the one previous: During the third flight, the engines pulled off full-duration burns as the vehicle ascended, and Starship ultimately reached orbit for the first time.\nEventually, SpaceX aims to land both the Super Heavy booster and Starship second stage at its launch facility in southeast Texas, where they can be rapidly refurbished and returned to the pad.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon to expand drone delivery service after clearing FAA hurdle\ndescription1:\nAn Amazon delivery drone is on display at Amazon's BOS27 Robotics Innovation Hub in Westborough, Massachusetts, on Nov. 10, 2022.\nAmazon said Thursday it has received federal approval to fly its delivery drones longer distances without the need for ground spotters, clearing a key regulatory hurdle and opening the door for the company to scale the service to more parts of the U.S.\nPreviously, Amazon was required to fly its drones within a pilot's view. The Federal Aviation Administration's approval allows Amazon to conduct flights beyond an observer's line of sight.\nThe company said it will expand its delivery area in College Station, Texas, one of the cities where it has been conducting tests.\nAmazon received approval after it developed a collision-avoidance technology onboard the drones, enabling them to \"detect and avoid obstacles in the air.\" The technology has been a key tool for other drone delivery companies, such as Zipline, looking to operate beyond visual line of sight, or BVLOS.\nThe e-commerce giant's drone delivery service, Prime Air, has struggled since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos laid out his vision for the program more than a decade ago.\nIn 2022, Amazon said it would begin testing deliveries in College Station, Texas, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, and Lockeford, a town south of Sacramento where the program was initially met with some skepticism by residents.\nPrime Air was hit by layoffs last year as part of broader job cuts at Amazon. The group also encountered regulatory setbacks and executive departures. Last month, Amazon said it would end its drone operations in California and begin deliveries near Phoenix, Arizona, later this year.\nIt is also eyeing further expansion to other U.S. cities in 2025. The company has said it aims to deliver 500 million packages by drone per year by the end of the decade.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle to invest $2 billion in Malaysia and build data center to meet AI demand\ndescription2:\nThe Google corporate logo hangs outside one of its offices on August 31, 2021.\nGoogle on Thursday said it will invest $2 billion in Malaysia, with part of the funds going toward building its first data center and cloud region in the country, as the demand for AI and cloud services rises.\n\"This investment builds on our partnership with the Government of Malaysia to advance its 'Cloud First Policy,' including best-in-class cybersecurity standards,\" Ruth Porat, president, CFO, and CIO at Alphabet and Google, said in a statement.\nPorat added that the investment will be Google's largest yet in Malaysia in its 13 years of operation there.\nThe data center will power Google's digital services, such as Search, Maps, and Workspace, while the cloud region will provide services to companies and organizations in the public and private sectors. Google also launched two AI literacy programs in the country for students and educators.\nThese investments and programs are expected to contribute more than $3.2 billion to Malaysia's GDP and support 26,500 jobs by 2030.\nThe Malaysia cloud region is the latest addition to Google's network of 40 regions and 121 zones in the world, the U.S. tech giant said.\nThis comes after Microsoft said earlier this month it will invest $2.2 billion in Malaysia to advance new cloud and AI infrastructure. It also announced investments in Indonesia and Thailand this year.\nTech giants like Google and Microsoft have pledged billions of dollars to Southeast Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for AI and cloud computing services.\nThe AI boom has boosted demand for cloud computing services and data centers, as large amounts of data are required to train AI models and the cloud provides access to vast datasets. Data centers are facilities that contain servers and other infrastructure needed to store data and run applications or services.\n\"Google's $2 billion investment in Malaysia will significantly advance the digital ambitions outlined in our New Industrial Master Plan 2030,\" YB Senator Tengku Datuk Seri Utama Zafrul Aziz, minister of investment, trade and industry, said in a press release.\nThe minister added that Google's investments will enable manufacturing and service-based industries to leverage AI and other advanced technologies so that they can \"move up the global chain.\"\n\ntitle3:\niOS 18 (and AI) will give Siri much more control over your apps\ndescription3:\nApple is planning a big AI update for Siri, and it could give you the ability to control specific iPhone app features with your voice, according to a report from Bloomberg. The revamped Siri will reportedly arrive next year as an update to iOS 18.\nAs noted by Bloomberg, the update will allow Siri to analyze the activity on your phone while turning on Siri-controlled features automatically. You\u2019ll only be able to use Siri to control features in apps made by Apple to start, but the company plans on supporting \u201chundreds\u201d of commands within its apps, Bloomberg reports.\nSiri will reportedly only be capable of processing one command at a time. However, Apple will eventually let Siri handle multiple tasks in a single request, such as asking Siri to summarize a recorded meeting and then send it to a friend, according to Bloomberg.\nThat sounds a bit like what Samsung promised when it launched Bixby in 2017, saying \u201canything you can do with touch, you can do with voice\u201d inside Samsung\u2019s apps. It\u2019s unclear how the technology will work exactly, but a recent demo from Microsoft showed how its GPT-4o-powered Copilot assistant could watch the screen to do things like give tips on how to play Minecraft.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Apple will focus on handling many AI requests on-device. It could process simpler commands on the iPhone, while fetching more complex requests from the cloud. There are rumors that OpenAI has closed a deal with Apple and that Apple will promote the security of its cloud processing by using M2 Ultra chips with its Secure Enclave, telling users that data processed remotely is as secure as when it\u2019s on their device.\nThis tracks with the multiple reports we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks. Research papers indicate Apple is getting ready to overhaul Siri, while findings from AppleInsider suggest Apple could add the ability to analyze and summarize texts in Messages. The company is also reportedly planning to bring AI transcription to Voice Memos and Notes.\n\ntitle4:\nSpotify offers Car Thing refunds as it faces lawsuit over bricking the streaming device\ndescription4:\nSpotify is facing continued backlash over its decision to discontinue support for Car Thing, its in-car streaming device, announced earlier in May. The device will no longer work starting on December 9, 2024, the company said. On TikTok, Gen Z users are posting videos to express their discontent with Spotify\u2019s move and its recommended actions \u2014 like switching to Android Auto or CarPlay. Often, they didn\u2019t have access to built-in infotainment systems in their car in the first place, making them a target market for a dedicated player like Car Thing, the users note.\nThe streaming service\u2019s in-car gadget hadn\u2019t been out on the market long enough to make it obsolete. It launched in February 2022 and was discontinued later that same year but with promises to keep it operational for those who already bought units. Ahead of its launch, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek had suggested there was consumer demand for such a product, telling investors on an earnings call that more than 2 million users had signed up on the Car Thing waitlist in anticipation of its release.\nImage Credits: Spotify\nThough Spotify never shared official numbers, it\u2019s likely that Car Thing underperformed or was just not worth continued investment in today\u2019s tighter economic market. The latter saw Spotify laying off around 1,500 staffers late last year, for example, after cuts earlier in the year that had affected hundreds.\nCar Thing users, however, don\u2019t care about the company\u2019s financial concerns; they just want their gadget to work, or at least be refunded for its $90 price tag.\nThat\u2019s led to some trying to directly complain to Spotify via DMs on X with @SpotifyCares or through various Spotify emails shared on Reddit. By doing so, some users reported that Spotify offered them several months of a Premium subscription to make up for their loss, while others claimed they asked customer service and were told no one was being reimbursed.\nSpotify tells TechCrunch that it has more recently instituted a refund process for Car Thing, provided the user has proof of purchase.\nThe ability to reach customer support was officially communicated to Car Thing users in a second email that went out on Friday of last week after the backlash over Car Thing\u2019s discontinuation had grown. In it, Spotify directs users to the correct customer support link to reach out to the company. The email does not promise any refunds, however, but says users can reach out with questions.\nWhile a refund may satisfy some portion of the user base that\u2019s upset over Car Thing, many are still pleading with the company via TikTok videos and in the comments on Spotify\u2019s TikTok posts to please not brick their device. (In fact, complaints about the Car Thing are now so common on Spotify\u2019s videos that the algorithmically recommended search TikTok suggests on some videos is \u201cwhat is the spotify car thing.\u201d)\n\u201cSPOTIFY PLEASE SPARE ME \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I LOVE MY CAR THING,\u201d wrote Carla, a TikTok user who goes by the handle @carlititica on the service.\n\u201cSad,\u201d wrote another user, @nikkilovestech. \u201cIt\u2019s like they want people to use their phone which is distracting,\u201d she wrote in the description of her video demoing a Car Thing mounted to her dash. In her video, she also commented on the e-waste that comes from discontinuing a product that still works \u201cperfectly fine.\u201d\nSpotify\u2019s headaches around Car Thing\u2019s discontinuation are not over yet, despite the newly introduced \u2014 if not widely broadcast \u2014 refund process. The company is also facing a class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which claims Spotify misled consumers by selling them a soon-to-be obsolete product and then not offering refunds, reports Billboard. The suit was filed on May 28.\nSpotify cannot comment on the lawsuit, but a spokesperson shared the following statement about Car Thing:\nThe goal of our Car Thing exploration in the U.S. was to learn more about how people listen in the car. In July 2022, we announced we\u2019d stop further production and now it\u2019s time to say goodbye to the devices entirely. Users will have until December 9, 2024 until all Car Thing devices will be deactivated. To learn more about all of the ways you can continue to listen to Spotify in the car, check out For The Record, and Car Thing users can reach out to Customer Support with any questions: https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/\nThough the troubles around Car Thing won\u2019t affect all of Spotify\u2019s user base, the news comes at a time when users are already upset that they\u2019re being asked to pay more for things they consider core to a music service, like access to lyrics, a feature Spotify recently paywalled.
