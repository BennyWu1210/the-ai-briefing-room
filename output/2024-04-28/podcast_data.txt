        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.

Welp, Tesla earnings happened this week — and yeah that was a lot. A lot of what, you ask? A lot of the same kinds of promises and hand waving we’ve seen before, but just wrapped up in slightly different packaging. The stakes this time around remind me of Tesla’s pre-profit era circa 2018.
Now, to be clear, Tesla has enjoyed profitability since 2020. But it is facing downward pressure on its bottom line — the company saw profits fall 55% year over year — and an aging portfolio of its highest volume vehicles. (And yes, we covered the new Model 3 Performance variant; I’m talking about new mass market models here.)
Tesla CEO Elon Musk needs to generate new sources of revenue. And fast. The company can’t wait two years or more to launch a new platform to deliver a sub-$25,000 EV.
So Musk tweaked that plan, from what we know so far. Which isn’t a lot. During the Q1 earnings call, Musk presented an opaque plan with few details to launch multiple cheaper EVs in 2025 (and maybe even late 2024).
Musk understands that the market has rewarded him in the past for being a forward thinker and an innovator — even if those plans don’t come to fruition. So, Musk also pulled on that futurist lever, promising greater levels of automated driving capability in its FSD driver-assistance software and a robotaxi (again). Lest you forget, Musk announced during the company’s Autonomy Day in 2019 that Tesla was going to launch a robotaxi network by the following year. Musk has talked about the Tesla Network and its ambitions to allow owners to place their vehicles on the ride-hailing app since 2016.
Shareholders responded with glee because the future is now, or maybe next year. Okay, maybe at the end of the decade? Anyway, it’s exciting.
In an unrelated note, the recently departed high-profile Tesla exec Drew Baglino sold about 1.14 million of his shares worth $181.47 million. The filing described it as an exercise of stock options.
Let’s go!
A little bird
A little bird pointed out to me that Valeo CTO Geoffrey Bouquot is leaving the company after eight years. For the unfamiliar, Valeo is a French car parts supplier that has pushed into the EV and automated driving space. The company even has an AI research center dedicated to automotive applications.
That EV sector had been promising for Valeo, but this recent quarter reflected what is happening in the rest of the sector. The company posted lower first-quarter sales after its high-voltage electrification system sales fell by nearly half. Valeo is now adjusting to automakers’ needs aka hybrids.

Here’s a nerdy one I enjoyed. Automotive electronics supplier Elektrobit announced EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications. What do those words even mean? Ars Technica has a nice explainer, but basically Elektrobit developed an open source-based automotive operating system that has been certified for automotive safety compliance. If you care about “software-defined vehicles,” this matters!
This week’s wheels
The 2024 Lexus LC 500h is not an EV. But over here at TC, we are also interested in hybrids! Plus, it’s been a minute since I have spent some time exploring the many offerings under the Lexus brand. The Lexus LC 500h starts at $101,250, but the version I drove popped up to $113,350 thanks to some additional premium touches like an upgraded audio system, retractable wing and a carbon fiber roof.
The Lexus LC 500h isn’t a vehicle you see every day, or year even. I suppose it’s because coupes are not so popular these days — crossovers rule that roost — although I quite like the looks and proportions of the Lexus LC 500h and its V8-engined twin.
This vehicle comes with a 3.5L, six-cylinder hybrid engine that produces 354 horsepower thanks to the addition of an electric motor that delivers power to the rear wheels. Another electric motor is what charges up the vehicle’s battery.
The curious part is that this vehicle has a multistage transmission. So basically this means that Lexus took its existing electronically controlled, continuously variable transmission system and then added another gearbox (a four-speed transmission) behind it. The thinking is that this gives drivers a sportier experience and 10 different gear selections via the paddles behind the steering wheel when the vehicle is in manual mode. The Lexus multistage hybrid system has been around for years now, but I had yet to really play around with it.
My take: After some time in manual mode, I found myself just putting it back in “drive” and letting the vehicle do the work for me.

Stripe's big changes, Brazil's newest fintech unicorn and the tale of a startup shutdown
description1:
Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! This week, we’re looking at Stripe’s big product announcements, a bump in valuation for a Brazilian fintech startup and much more!
To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Sunday at 7:00 a.m. PT, subscribe here.
The big story
Stripe announced that it will be de-coupling payments from the rest of its financial services stack. This is a big change, considering that in the past, even as Stripe grew its list of services, it required businesses to be payments customers in order to use any of the rest. Alongside this, the company is adding in a number of new embedded finance features and a new wave of AI tools. The fintech giant also announced that after a six-year hiatus, it will let customers accept cryptocurrency payments, starting with just one currency in particular, USDC stablecoins, initially only on Solana, Ethereum and Polygon.
Analysis of the week
Brazil got a new fintech unicorn last week. Banking-as-a-service startup QI Tech achieved unicorn status after raising an undisclosed amount of capital in a General Atlantic-led investment that was an extension of its $200 million Series B raise, which TechCrunch covered last October. QI Tech said it is also preparing to close on the acquisition of Singulare, a Brazilian fund administration services provider, in the third quarter. Meanwhile, another Brazilian startup, Vixtra, secured $36 million in debt and equity funding — another example of companies in the region continuing to attract venture dollars.
Dollars and cents
Bump, a platform that helps creators manage and grow their businesses, announced a $3 million seed round, with investments from ImpactX, Capitalize and Serac Ventures. Bump allows creators to track income and market value, which can help them negotiate better deals and see how much money partners owe them.
Y Combinator alum and B2B fintech startup Fintoc raised a $7 million Series A round of funding to consolidate its presence in its home country, Chile, and in Mexico, where it expanded one year ago.
Pomelo, a startup that launched in the Philippines in 2022 — allowing people in the United States to send money to the country while at the same time building their credit — has raised $35 million in a Series A round led by Dubai venture firm Vy Capital with participation from Founders Fund.
You can hear the Equity crew talk about this deal and more here:
What else we’re writing
Bengaluru-headquartered CRED, valued at $6.4 billion, has received the in-principle approval for a payment aggregator license in a boost to the Indian fintech startup that could help it better serve its customers and launch new products and experiment with ideas faster.
Winding down a startup can be bittersweet for founders. In the case of Fundid, rising interest rates killed the business finance startup. But VCs and partners hurt it, too, founder Stefanie Sample says in this compelling read by Christine Hall.
After a tumultuous year, banking-as-a-service (BaaS) startup Synapse has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its assets will be acquired by TabaPay.

ChatGPT's 'hallucination' problem hit with another privacy complaint in EU
description2:
OpenAI is facing another privacy complaint in the European Union. This one, which has been filed by privacy rights nonprofit noyb on behalf of an individual complainant, targets the inability of its AI chatbot ChatGPT to correct misinformation it generates about individuals.
The tendency of GenAI tools to produce information that’s plain wrong has been well documented. But it also sets the technology on a collision course with the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — which governs how the personal data of regional users can be processed.
Penalties for GDPR compliance failures can reach up to 4% of global annual turnover. Rather more importantly for a resource-rich giant like OpenAI: Data protection regulators can order changes to how information is processed, so GDPR enforcement could reshape how generative AI tools are able to operate in the EU.
OpenAI was already forced to make some changes after an early intervention by Italy’s data protection authority, which briefly forced a local shut down of ChatGPT back in 2023.
Now noyb is filing the latest GDPR complaint against ChatGPT with the Austrian data protection authority on behalf of an unnamed complainant (described as a “public figure”) who found the AI chatbot produced an incorrect birth date for them.
Under the GDPR, people in the EU have a suite of rights attached to information about them, including a right to have erroneous data corrected. noyb contends OpenAI is failing to comply with this obligation in respect of its chatbot’s output. It said the company refused the complainant’s request to rectify the incorrect birth date, responding that it was technically impossible for it to correct.
Instead it offered to filter or block the data on certain prompts, such as the name of the complainant.
OpenAI’s privacy policy states users who notice the AI chatbot has generated “factually inaccurate information about you” can submit a “correction request” through privacy.openai.com or by emailing dsar@openai.com. However, it caveats the line by warning: “Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy in every instance.”
In that case, OpenAI suggests users request that it removes their personal information from ChatGPT’s output entirely — by filling out a web form.
The problem for the AI giant is that GDPR rights are not à la carte. People in Europe have a right to request rectification. They also have a right to request deletion of their data. But, as noyb points out, it’s not for OpenAI to choose which of these rights are available.
Other elements of the complaint focus on GDPR transparency concerns, with noyb contending OpenAI is unable to say where the data it generates on individuals comes from, nor what data the chatbot stores about people.
This is important because, again, the regulation gives individuals a right to request such info by making a so-called subject access request (SAR). Per noyb, OpenAI did not adequately respond to the complainant’s SAR, failing to disclose any information about the data processed, its sources, or recipients.
Commenting on the complaint in a statement, Maartje de Graaf, data protection lawyer at noyb, said: “Making up false information is quite problematic in itself. But when it comes to false information about individuals, there can be serious consequences. It’s clear that companies are currently unable to make chatbots like ChatGPT comply with EU law, when processing data about individuals. If a system cannot produce accurate and transparent results, it cannot be used to generate data about individuals. The technology has to follow the legal requirements, not the other way around.”
The company said it’s asking the Austrian DPA to investigate the complaint about OpenAI’s data processing, as well as urging it to impose a fine to ensure future compliance. But it added that it’s “likely” the case will be dealt with via EU cooperation.
OpenAI is facing a very similar complaint in Poland. Last September, the local data protection authority opened an investigation of ChatGPT following the complaint by a privacy and security researcher who also found he was unable to have incorrect information about him corrected by OpenAI. That complaint also accuses the AI giant of failing to comply with the regulation’s transparency requirements.
The Italian data protection authority, meanwhile, still has an open investigation into ChatGPT. In January it produced a draft decision, saying then that it believes OpenAI has violated the GDPR in a number of ways, including in relation to the chatbot’s tendency to produce misinformation about people. The findings also pertain to other crux issues, such as the lawfulness of processing.
The Italian authority gave OpenAI a month to respond to its findings. A final decision remains pending.
Now, with another GDPR complaint fired at its chatbot, the risk of OpenAI facing a string of GDPR enforcements across different Member States has dialed up.
Last fall the company opened a regional office in Dublin — in a move that looks intended to shrink its regulatory risk by having privacy complaints funneled by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, thanks to a mechanism in the GDPR that’s intended to streamline oversight of cross-border complaints by funneling them to a single member state authority where the company is “main established.”

How working for Big Tech lost 'dream job' status
description3:
Despite blockbuster earnings from giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft , layoffs continue to ripple through the tech industry.
Layoffs.fyi, a platform monitoring job cuts in the tech sector, recorded more than 263,000 job losses in 2023 alone. As of April, there have been more than 75,000 job losses in the industry so far in 2024.
"So instead of rewarding the growth that we saw [tech companies] all pursue years ago, they're now rewarding profit," said Jeff Shulman, professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business. "And so the layoffs have continued. People have become used to them. Regrettably and sadly, it seems that the layoffs are going to be the new normal."
Even though mass tech layoffs continue, the labor market still seems strong. The U.S. economy added 303,000 jobs in March, well above the Dow Jones estimate for a rise of 200,000, with the unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%.
According to Handshake, a popular free job posting site for college students and graduates, the tech layoffs have prompted new workers to seek other opportunities. The share of job applications from tech majors submitted to internet and software companies dropped by more than 30% between November 2021 and September 2023.
"Part of the reason why this is happening is because stability is such a major factor in students' decisions around what types of jobs they apply to and what types of jobs they accept," said Christine Cruzverga, chief education strategy officer at Handshake. "They're looking at the headlines in the news and they're paying attention to all of the layoffs that are happening in Big Tech, and that makes them feel unstable."
Mass layoffs have eroded the shine of the tech industry, which is why workers are questioning whether getting a job in the tech industry should still be regarded as a "dream job."
"For the people who are chasing ... a tech dream job, I think keep your options open and be realistic," said Eric Tolotti, senior partner engineer at Snowflake, who got laid off from Microsoft in 2023. "Don't just focus on one company and feel like you have to get into that one company because it's the dream."

Meta’s ‘set it and forget it’ AI ad tools are misfiring and blowing through cash
description4:
It was Valentine’s Day when Meta’s ad platform started going off the rails. RC Williams, the co-founder of the Philadelphia-based marketing agency 1-800-D2C, had set one of Meta’s automated ad tools to run campaigns for two separate clients. But when he checked the platform that day, he found that Meta had blown through roughly 75 percent of the daily ad budgets for both clients in under a couple of hours.
Williams told The Verge that the ads’ CPMs, or cost per impressions, were roughly 10 times higher than normal. A usual CPM of under $28 had inflated to roughly $250, way above the industry average. That would have been bad enough if the revenue earned from those ads wasn’t nearly zero. If you’re not a marketer, this might feel like spending a week’s worth of grocery money on a prime cut of wagyu at a steakhouse, only for the waiter to return with a floppy slider.
The Verge spoke to several marketers and businesses that advertise on Meta’s platforms who tell a similar story. Meta’s automated ad platform has been blowing through budgets and failing to deliver sales. Small businesses have seen their ad dollars get wiped out and wasted as a result, and some have said the bouts of overspending are driving them from Meta’s platforms.
“Meta’s unwillingness to be transparent or accountable with the performance issues and glitches is causing mass uncertainty.”
“Meta’s unwillingness to be transparent or accountable with the performance issues and glitches is causing mass uncertainty,” Karl Baker, founder of meditation startup Mindfulness Works, wrote in a message to The Verge.
The faulty ad service in question, known as Advantage Plus shopping campaigns, is part of a full suite of AI-enabled ad tools that Meta pitches to businesses as a faster and more efficient alternative to manual ad campaigns. To create an ad campaign, advertisers upload their creative assets, pick their conversion goals (e.g., getting more customers to make purchases on Instagram), and then set their budget caps. Meta hyped Advantage Plus shopping campaigns during earnings calls as a carefree, “set it and forget it” automated solution to online ads. But that hasn’t been the case, marketers say.
Advantage Plus shopping campaigns have been unpredictable, seemingly working well on some days and then not so well on other days. The subreddit r/FacebookAds has become a sort of 24/7 help desk for Advantage Plus. Recent headings discussing the issues include “Advantage+ sucks,” “Is Facebook broken rn,” and “Is it just me?”
“People are always saying, ‘Is it me?’ or ‘Is it Meta?’” Baker said.
What Williams and many other marketers thought was a one-time glitch by Advantage Plus ended up becoming a recurring incident for weeks. “Since February 14th, [Advantage Plus] has overspent on numerous occasions and ignored the cost caps we have in place on it,” he said.
Problems have persisted into April. “We have a couple of clients for whom we completely stopped Advantage Plus due to these anomalies,” said Aniruddha Mishra, director of growth at Miami-based digital marketing agency Node Media. He noted that for some clients, CPMs on Meta were anywhere from three to four times more expensive than they were last year.
Advertisers say getting support from Meta has been a challenge, too. Meta laid off thousands of employees over the past year and gutted many of its customer support teams. As Digiday reported, Meta’s ad accounts teams were downsized, and many client inquiries are now being directed to AI chatbots. Several of the marketers that The Verge spoke to said that there’s been a noticeable decline in responsiveness from Meta since the transition.
“The only thing [Meta] acknowledged was there was a platform bug on February 14th and apologized for the inconvenience.”
“The only thing [Meta] acknowledged was there was a platform bug on February 14th and apologized for the inconvenience,” said Williams. “They didn’t tell us what actually happened.”
Meta eventually refunded 1-800-D2C for the incident, but Williams said it took him several tries to finally get someone from the company to acknowledge him. The company issued the refund almost a month after the incident.
While some users speculate that Advantage Plus is “glitching” or “broken,” Meta’s response has been to insist that the tool is functioning as it should.
“I’ve reached out to representatives at Meta, and I’ve been told that they’re not aware of any sort of glitch, which is truly shocking, because all my co-founder friends who work in e-commerce share this sentiment. They’re dealing with the same thing,” said Adriel Darvish, the CEO of a luxury handbag and jewelry service called Switch, in a phone interview with The Verge. “This is something universal that everyone is experiencing.”
With the problems continuing to pile on, Williams said his marketing firm completely halted its use of Advantage Plus in early April. Instead, they’ve gone back to the old-fashioned method of buying Facebook and Instagram ads manually. Notably, going back to the pre-AI, pre-automated way of doing things hasn’t really taken a toll on the firm’s human labor force.
“Maybe an extra 10 to 20 minutes or so to build out the ad sets, but nothing crazy,” said Williams.
Meta first launched Advantage Plus shopping campaigns globally in the fall of 2022, when the state of online advertising was in an uncertain place. Just a year before, Apple had launched its App Tracking Transparency feature with iOS 14.5, giving users an easy way to opt out of the third-party app-based tracking that powers many online ads. Meta opposed the change, saying it would “change the internet as we know it” and threaten the future of many online businesses.
But Meta’s real concern was no doubt the threat to its own ad business, which chalked up a $10 billion dip in ad revenue in 2021 due to Apple’s changes. Targeted ads were no longer as effective since brands no longer had access to as much data, and they were becoming more expensive to boot. As a consequence, brands cut back on their online ad spend.
With Advantage Plus shopping campaigns, Meta promised that AI and machine learning models could effectively replace the big gaping hole left by Apple’s privacy update.
In lieu of tracking users, Advantage Plus uses the advertiser’s own first-party sales data to help target ads. But online advertisers would be effectively handing the reins over to Meta and no longer have access to the granular targeting controls and detailed analytics they did prior to Apple’s privacy changes.
Although there was a bit of a “learning curve” with Advantage Plus shopping, the tool gradually began to improve. Brands noticed their AI-driven Meta ad campaigns were performing well and poured more of their budgets into the platform. Adweek reported that by April 2023, marketers who had ditched Meta for TikTok ads and newer opportunities like connected TV were starting to come back.
Advertisers had a honeymoon period with Advantage Plus last year, especially as Meta began packing it with new features. “Advantage Plus was working so well at this point, for most of the clients, that almost 50 to 70 percent of their ad budget is on Meta’s Advantage Plus campaigns. There are so many targeting and evolutions they’ve done in the past year and a half. It delivers a really strong performance if you know how to tweak the right parameters,” said Mishra.
In an email to The Verge on April 15th, Meta spokesperson Kash Ayodele said the company had fixed a “few technical issues” with the Advantage Plus ad platform. “Our ads system is working as expected for the vast majority of advertisers. We recently fixed a few technical issues and are researching a small amount of additional reports from advertisers to ensure the best possible results for businesses using our apps.”
But marketers are still complaining about underperformance on the platform. “Things have recovered for many, but not all. It’s been a very turbulent end to Q1 and beginning of Q2,” wrote media buyer David Herrmann in a direct message to The Verge.
The dramatic increase in cost per click (CPC) and CPM is not just a Meta problem — online ads as a whole are getting costlier due to what marketers say are increased inefficiencies, which automation has only made worse. This significantly decreases profits for individual advertisers. And fixing this problem may be more complicated than fixing a “glitch” or series of glitches on Advantage Plus, especially since the millions that Meta as well as Google have poured into automated advertising hasn’t led to more successful ad campaigns.
“The performance of accounts and campaigns hasn’t intrinsically increased [over the last three years],” noted Hawke Media’s Areen Mayelan.
When ad campaigns are automated, such as with Meta’s Advantage Plus, “things get brushed under the rug,” said Mayelan. Everything from loose keywords to loose audiences to low-quality ads all effectively become inefficiencies that increase the cost of ads for brands. “Inefficiency results in an increase in CPCs and CPMs, because you’re creating artificial ‘competition’ where there otherwise might not be.”"

soy wall-e, y esta es tu sesión informativa de ai briefing. en las noticias de hoy, tesla ve caer sus ganancias mientras fisker se estanca, y las ciudades de california luchan por el control de los vehículos autónomos. mientras tanto, stripe anuncia grandes cambios y brasil da la bienvenida a su nuevo unicornio fintech. en otra parte, openai enfrenta otra queja de privacidad en la unión europea debido al problema de "alucinación" de chatgpt. además, trabajar para big tech ha perdido su estatus de "trabajo soñado". y en una historia relacionada con la publicidad, la herramienta de anuncios ia de meta está fallando y consumiendo rápidamente el presupuesto de los anunciantes.

tesla reportó una caída del 55% en las ganancias año tras año, provocando al ceo elon musk a buscar nuevas fuentes de ingresos con urgencia. stripe, por otro lado, ha decidido desvincular los pagos del resto de su pila de servicios financieros y volver a permitir pagos en criptomonedas después de seis años. mientras tanto, qi tech, un startup de fintech brasileño, ha alcanzado el estatus de unicornio después de una ronda de inversión liderada por general atlantic.
