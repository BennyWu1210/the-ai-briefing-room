Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.

Welp, Tesla earnings happened this week — and yeah that was a lot. A lot of what, you ask? A lot of the same kinds of promises and hand waving we’ve seen before, but just wrapped up in slightly different packaging. The stakes this time around remind me of Tesla’s pre-profit era circa 2018.
Now, to be clear, Tesla has enjoyed profitability since 2020. But it is facing downward pressure on its bottom line — the company saw profits fall 55% year over year — and an aging portfolio of its highest volume vehicles. (And yes, we covered the new Model 3 Performance variant; I’m talking about new mass market models here.)
Tesla CEO Elon Musk needs to generate new sources of revenue. And fast. The company can’t wait two years or more to launch a new platform to deliver a sub-$25,000 EV.
So Musk tweaked that plan, from what we know so far. Which isn’t a lot. During the Q1 earnings call, Musk presented an opaque plan with few details to launch multiple cheaper EVs in 2025 (and maybe even late 2024).
Musk understands that the market has rewarded him in the past for being a forward thinker and an innovator — even if those plans don’t come to fruition. So, Musk also pulled on that futurist lever, promising greater levels of automated driving capability in its FSD driver-assistance software and a robotaxi (again). Lest you forget, Musk announced during the company’s Autonomy Day in 2019 that Tesla was going to launch a robotaxi network by the following year. Musk has talked about the Tesla Network and its ambitions to allow owners to place their vehicles on the ride-hailing app since 2016.
Shareholders responded with glee because the future is now, or maybe next year. Okay, maybe at the end of the decade? Anyway, it’s exciting.
In an unrelated note, the recently departed high-profile Tesla exec Drew Baglino sold about 1.14 million of his shares worth $181.47 million. The filing described it as an exercise of stock options.
Let’s go!
A little bird
A little bird pointed out to me that Valeo CTO Geoffrey Bouquot is leaving the company after eight years. For the unfamiliar, Valeo is a French car parts supplier that has pushed into the EV and automated driving space. The company even has an AI research center dedicated to automotive applications.
That EV sector had been promising for Valeo, but this recent quarter reflected what is happening in the rest of the sector. The company posted lower first-quarter sales after its high-voltage electrification system sales fell by nearly half. Valeo is now adjusting to automakers’ needs aka hybrids.

This week’s wheels
The 2024 Lexus LC 500h is not an EV. But over here at TC, we are also interested in hybrids! Plus, it’s been a minute since I have spent some time exploring the many offerings under the Lexus brand. The Lexus LC 500h starts at $101,250, but the version I drove popped up to $113,350 thanks to some additional premium touches like an upgraded audio system, retractable wing and a carbon fiber roof.
The Lexus LC 500h isn’t a vehicle you see every day, or year even. I suppose it’s because coupes are not so popular these days — crossovers rule that roost — although I quite like the looks and proportions of the Lexus LC 500h and its V8-engined twin.
This vehicle comes with a 3.5L, six-cylinder hybrid engine that produces 354 horsepower thanks to the addition of an electric motor that delivers power to the rear wheels. Another electric motor is what charges up the vehicle’s battery.
The curious part is that this vehicle has a multistage transmission. So basically this means that Lexus took its existing electronically controlled, continuously variable transmission system and then added another gearbox (a four-speed transmission) behind it. The thinking is that this gives drivers a sportier experience and 10 different gear selections via the paddles behind the steering wheel when the vehicle is in manual mode. The Lexus multistage hybrid system has been around for years now, but I had yet to really play around with it.
My take: After some time in manual mode, I found myself just putting it back in “drive” and letting the vehicle do the work for me.

Meta’s ‘set it and forget it’ AI ad tools are misfiring and blowing through cash
It was Valentine’s Day when Meta’s ad platform started going off the rails. RC Williams, the co-founder of the Philadelphia-based marketing agency 1-800-D2C, had set one of Meta’s automated ad tools to run campaigns for two separate clients. But when he checked the platform that day, he found that Meta had blown through roughly 75 percent of the daily ad budgets for both clients in under a couple of hours.
Williams told The Verge that the ads’ CPMs, or cost per impressions, were roughly 10 times higher than normal. A usual CPM of under $28 had inflated to roughly $250, way above the industry average. That would have been bad enough if the revenue earned from those ads wasn’t nearly zero. If you’re not a marketer, this might feel like spending a week’s worth of grocery money on a prime cut of wagyu at a steakhouse, only for the waiter to return with a floppy slider.
The Verge spoke to several marketers and businesses that advertise on Meta’s platforms who tell a similar story. Meta’s automated ad platform has been blowing through budgets and failing to deliver sales. Small businesses have seen their ad dollars get wiped out and wasted as a result, and some have said the bouts of overspending are driving them from Meta’s platforms.
“Meta’s unwillingness to be transparent or accountable with the performance issues and glitches is causing mass uncertainty.”
“Meta’s unwillingness to be transparent or accountable with the performance issues and glitches is causing mass uncertainty,” Karl Baker, founder of meditation startup Mindfulness Works, wrote in a message to The Verge.
The faulty ad service in question, known as Advantage Plus shopping campaigns, is part of a full suite of AI-enabled ad tools that Meta pitches to businesses as a faster and more efficient alternative to manual ad campaigns. To create an ad campaign, advertisers upload their creative assets, pick their conversion goals (e.g., getting more customers to make purchases on Instagram), and then set their budget caps. Meta hyped Advantage Plus shopping campaigns during earnings calls as a carefree, “set it and forget it” automated solution to online ads. But that hasn’t been the case, marketers say.
Advantage Plus shopping campaigns have been unpredictable, seemingly working well on some days and then not so well on other days. The subreddit r/FacebookAds has become a sort of 24/7 help desk for Advantage Plus. Recent headings discussing the issues include “Advantage+ sucks,” “Is Facebook broken rn,” and “Is it just me?”
“People are always saying, ‘Is it me?’ or ‘Is it Meta?’” Baker said.
What Williams and many other marketers thought was a one-time glitch by Advantage Plus ended up becoming a recurring incident for weeks. “Since February 14th, [Advantage Plus] has overspent on numerous occasions and ignored the cost caps we have in place on it,” he said.
Problems have persisted into April. “We have a couple of clients for whom we completely stopped Advantage Plus due to these anomalies,” said Aniruddha Mishra, director of growth at Miami-based digital marketing agency Node Media. He noted that for some clients, CPMs on Meta were anywhere from three to four times more expensive than they were last year.
Advertisers say getting support from Meta has been a challenge, too. Meta laid off thousands of employees over the past year and gutted many of its customer support teams. As Digiday reported, Meta’s ad accounts teams were downsized, and many client inquiries are now being directed to AI chatbots. Several of the marketers that The Verge spoke to said that there’s been a noticeable decline in responsiveness from Meta since the transition.
“The only thing [Meta] acknowledged was there was a platform bug on February 14th and apologized for the inconvenience.”
“The only thing [Meta] acknowledged was there was a platform bug on February 14th and apologized for the inconvenience,” said Williams. “They didn’t tell us what actually happened.”
Meta eventually refunded 1-800-D2C for the incident, but Williams said it took him several tries to finally get someone from the company to acknowledge him. The company issued the refund almost a month after the incident.
While some users speculate that Advantage Plus is “glitching” or “broken,” Meta’s response has been to insist that the tool is functioning as it should.
“I’ve reached out to representatives at Meta, and I’ve been told that they’re not aware of any sort of glitch, which is truly shocking, because all my co-founder friends who work in e-commerce share this sentiment. They’re dealing with the same thing,” said Adriel Darvish, the CEO of a luxury handbag and jewelry service called Switch, in a phone interview with The Verge. “This is something universal that everyone is experiencing.”
With the problems continuing to pile on, Williams said his marketing firm completely halted its use of Advantage Plus in early April. Instead, they’ve gone back to the old-fashioned method of buying Facebook and Instagram ads manually. Notably, going back to the pre-AI, pre-automated way of doing things hasn’t really taken a toll on the firm’s human labor force.
“Maybe an extra 10 to 20 minutes or so to build out the ad sets, but nothing crazy,” said Williams.
Meta first launched Advantage Plus shopping campaigns globally in the fall of 2022, when the state of online advertising was in an uncertain place. Just a year before, Apple had launched its App Tracking Transparency feature with iOS 14.5, giving users an easy way to opt out of the third-party app-based tracking that powers many online ads. Meta opposed the change, saying it would “change the internet as we know it” and threaten the future of many online businesses.
But Meta’s real concern was no doubt the threat to its own ad business, which chalked up a $10 billion dip in ad revenue in 2021 due to Apple’s changes. Targeted ads were no longer as effective since brands no longer had access to as much data, and they were becoming more expensive to boot. As a consequence, brands cut back on their online ad spend.
With Advantage Plus shopping campaigns, Meta promised that AI and machine learning models could effectively replace the big gaping hole left by Apple’s privacy update.
In lieu of tracking users, Advantage Plus uses the advertiser’s own first-party sales data to help target ads. But online advertisers would be effectively handing the reins over to Meta and no longer have access to the granular targeting controls and detailed analytics they did prior to Apple’s privacy changes.
Although there was a bit of a “learning curve” with Advantage Plus shopping, the tool gradually began to improve. Brands noticed their AI-driven Meta ad campaigns were performing well and poured more of their budgets into the platform. Adweek reported that by April 2023, marketers who had ditched Meta for TikTok ads and newer opportunities like connected TV were starting to come back.
Advertisers had a honeymoon period with Advantage Plus last year, especially as Meta began packing it with new features. “Advantage Plus was working so well at this point, for most of the clients, that almost 50 to 70 percent of their ad budget is on Meta’s Advantage Plus campaigns. There are so many targeting and evolutions they’ve done in the past year and a half. It delivers a really strong performance if you know how to tweak the right parameters,” said Mishra.
In an email to The Verge on April 15th, Meta spokesperson Kash Ayodele said the company had fixed a “few technical issues” with the Advantage Plus ad platform. “Our ads system is working as expected for the vast majority of advertisers. We recently fixed a few technical issues and are researching a small amount of additional reports from advertisers to ensure the best possible results for businesses using our apps.”
But marketers are still complaining about underperformance on the platform. “Things have recovered for many, but not all. It’s been a very turbulent end to Q1 and beginning of Q2,” wrote media buyer David Herrmann in a direct message to The Verge.
The dramatic increase in cost per click (CPC) and CPM is not just a Meta problem — online ads as a whole are getting costlier due to what marketers say are increased inefficiencies, which automation has only made worse. This significantly decreases profits for individual advertisers. And fixing this problem may be more complicated than fixing a “glitch” or series of glitches on Advantage Plus, especially since the millions that Meta as well as Google have poured into automated advertising hasn’t led to more successful ad campaigns.
“The performance of accounts and campaigns hasn’t intrinsically increased [over the last three years],” noted Hawke Media’s Areen Mayelan.
When ad campaigns are automated, such as with Meta’s Advantage Plus, “things get brushed under the rug,” said Mayelan. Everything from loose keywords to loose audiences to low-quality ads all effectively become inefficiencies that increase the cost of ads for brands. “Inefficiency results in an increase in CPCs and CPMs, because you’re creating artificial ‘competition’ where there otherwise might not be.”

MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria talks AI hype and the database evolution as he crosses 10-year mark
A lot has happened since Dev Ittycheria took the reins at MongoDB, the $26 billion database company he’s led as president and CEO since September 2014. Ittycheria has taken MongoDB to the cloud, steered it through an IPO, overseen its transition from open source, launched a venture capital arm, and grown the customer base from a few hundred to something approaching 50,000.
“When I joined the company, it wasn’t clear if people would trust us to be a truly mission-critical technology,” Ittycheria told TechCrunch. “When I joined, it was doing roughly $30 million in revenue; now we’re doing close to $2 billion.”
It hasn’t all been peaches and cream, though. Five months ago, MongoDB was hit by a security breach, which, while relatively contained, did momentarily risk its reputation in an industry where reputation is paramount.
Throw into the mix the whirlwind AI revolution that has engulfed just about every industry, and there was much to discuss when TechCrunch sat down with Ittycheria at MongoDB’s new London office, which opened in Blackfriars last year.
Vector’s embrace
Databases have come a long way since IBM and Oracle first popularized relational databases more than half a century ago. The internet’s rise created demand for flexible, scalable, and cost-effective data storage and processing, paving the way for businesses such as MongoDB to thrive.
Founded in 2007 by a trio of veterans hailing from online adtech company DoubleClick (which Google acquired for $3.1 billion), MongoDB was initially called 10Gen until a rebrand to the name of its flagship product six years later. It has since emerged as one of the preeminent NoSQL databases, helping companies store and manage large volumes of data.
Prior to joining MongoDB, Ittycheria founded and exited a server automation company called BladeLogic for $900 million in 2008, and went on to serve in various board member and investor roles (including a 16-month stint at Greylock) before joining MongoDB as president and CEO coming on for 10 years ago now. Ittycheria replaced Max Schireson, who stepped down for family reasons after just 18 months in the role.
Built on a document-oriented model, MongoDB has grown off the back of the explosion in mobile and web applications where flexible, dynamic data structures are at play. The current artificial intelligence wave is driving a similar shift, with vector databases the hot new thing in town.
Like NoSQL, vector databases also specialize in unstructured data types (e.g., images, videos, social media posts), but are particularly well suited to large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. This is due to the way they store and process data in the form of vector embeddings, which convert data into numerical representations that capture relationships between different data points by storing them spatially by relevance. This makes it easier to retrieve semantically similar data and allows AI to better understand context and semantics within conversations.
While a slew of dedicated vector database startups have emerged these past few years, the incumbents have also started embracing vector, including Elastic, Redis, OpenSearch, Cassandra, and Oracle. Cloud hyperscalers, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have also ramped up support for vector search.
MongoDB, for its part, introduced vector search to its flagship database-as-a-service product Atlas last June, a sign that the company was preparing for the oncoming AI tsunami. This mimics other historical trends where single-function databases emerge (such as time-series) with some utility as stand-alone solutions but that might also be better integrated into a larger multi-purpose database stack. This is precisely why MongoDB introduced support for time-series databases a few years back, and why it’s doing the same with vector.
“A lot of these companies are features masking as products,” Ittycheria said of the new wave of dedicated vector products. “We built that into the platform, and that’s the value — rather using some stand-alone vector database and then your OLTP [online transaction processing] database and then your search database, we can combine all three things into one platform that makes the life of a developer and architect so much easier.”
The idea is that database providers that adopt a multipronged approach can combine all the data in one place, making life easier for developers to work with.
“There’s probably like 17 different types of databases, and probably about 300 vendors,” Ittycheria said. “There’s no customer on this planet that wants to have 17 different databases. The complexity that creates, and the cost of learning, supporting and managing those different technologies becomes overwhelming. It also inhibits innovation, because it creates this tax of complexity.”
Too much hype
Despite the preparation, Ittycheria reckons there is too much hype around AI — for now, at least.
“My life has not been transformed by AI,” he said. “Yes, maybe I can write an email better through all those assistants, but it’s not fundamentally transformed my life. Whereas the internet has completely transformed my life.”
The theory is that despite the hullaballoo, it will take time for AI to seep into our everyday lives — and when it does, it will be through applications integrating AI, and businesses building on it.
“I think with the adoption of any new technology, we see value accrue at the bottom layer first,” Ittycheria said. “Obviously, Nvidia is making money hand over fist, and OpenAI has been the most talked about company since they launched ChatGPT. But the real value will come when people build applications on top of those technologies. And that’s the business we’re in — we’re in the business of helping people build applications.”
For now, it’s all about “simple apps,” as Ittycheria puts it. This includes chatbots for customer service, something that MongoDB itself is doing internally with CoachGTM, powered by MongoDB’s vector search, to bring its sales and customer teams instant knowledge about their products. In some ways, we’re currently in the “calculator apps” stage that the iPhone found itself in nearly 20 years ago when the concept of the App Store hit the masses.
“The real sophisticated [AI] apps will be using real-time data, being able to make real-time decisions on real-time events,” Ittycheria said. “Maybe something’s happening in the stock market, maybe it’s time to buy or sell, or it’s time to hedge. I think that’s where we will start seeing much more sophisticated apps, where you can embed real-time data along with all the reasoning.”
The SaaS path
One of the biggest developments during Ittycheria’s tenure has been the transition from a self-deployed model, where customers host MongoDB themselves and the company sells them features and services. With the launch of Atlas in 2016, MongoDB embarked on the familiar SaaS path where companies charge for removing all the complexities of self-hosting. At the time of its IPO the following year, Atlas represented 2% of MongoDB’s revenue — today that figure sits at nearly 70%.
“It’s grown very quickly, and we’ve really built that business as a public company,” Ittycheria said. “What the popularity of Atlas showed was that people are comfortable consuming infrastructure as a service. What that allows them to do is delegate what they consider ‘non-strategic functions,’ like provisioning, configuring and managing MongoDB. So they can focus on building applications that are really transforming their business.”
Another major development came when, a year after going public, MongoDB moved away from an open source AGPL license to a source-available SSPL (server side public license). In some ways, this was the bellwether of what was to come, with countless infrastructure companies going on to abandon their open source credentials to prevent the cloud giants (e.g., Amazon) from selling their own version of the service without giving back.
“We feel very happy about it [the license change],” Ittycheria said. “The reality is that while it was open source, 99.9% of the development is done by our own people — it’s not like communities contributing code. It’s not some simple, trivial application — it’s very complex code, and we need to hire senior, talented people who cost a lot of money. We didn’t think it was fair for us to spend all this money to build this product, then someone takes that free product, monetizes it, and not give us anything back. It was quite controversial in 2018, but looking back, our business has only grown faster.”
And grown it has. As with just about every tech company, MongoDB’s valuation soared during the pandemic, peaking at an all-time high of $39 billion in late 2021, before plummeting south of $10 billion within a year — roughly the same as its pre-pandemic figure.
However, MongoDB’s shares have been in ascendency in the 18 months since, hitting $35 billion just a couple of months ago, before dropping again to around $26 billion today — such is the volatile nature of the stock markets. But given the company’s relatively modest $1.8 billion valuation at the end of its first day of trading in 2017, MongoDB has performed fairly well for public market investors.
Four months ago, though, MongoDB revealed a data breach that exposed “some customer account metadata and contact information” — it involved a phishing attack through a third-party enterprise tool (Ittycheria wouldn’t confirm which). This caused its shares to drop 3%, but in the months that followed, MongoDB’s valuation surged back to a two-year high. This highlighted how little impact the breach had on affairs at the company, certainly compared to high-profile data breaches at the likes of Equifax and Target, which hit the businesses hard and forced senior executive departures.
While MongoDB’s cybersecurity incident was significantly smaller in scope, what stood out was how quickly the whole thing went away — it was reported in several outlets (including TechCrunch), but the story disappeared into the foggy ruins of time just as quickly as it arrived.
“Part of the reason is that we were very transparent,” Ittycheria said. “The last thing you want to do is hide information and appear like you’re misrepresenting information. We have lots of banks who put a lot of very sensitive information in our data platform; we’ve lots of other companies that have a lot of sensitive information. So for us, it’s really about making sure that our architecture is robust and sound. And this really forced us to double down. I would never claim that we’re never gonna get hacked again, but we’re doing everything in our power to ensure that it doesn’t.”
Nothing ventured
It’s not unusual for the biggest tech companies to launch their own investment vehicles, as we’ve seen through the years with Alphabet (which has several investment offshoots), Microsoft, Amazon, and Salesforce all ingratiating themselves with the startup fraternity. But a newer wave of enterprise corporate venture firms have entered the fray, too, including Slack, Workday, Twilio, Zoom, HubSpot, and Okta.
In 2022, it was MongoDB’s turn to launch such a fund, and in the two years since, MongoDB Ventures has invested in some eight companies.
“This is for us to build deeper relationships — we work in an ecosystem that consists of large companies and also small companies,” Ittycheria said. “Where we see a small company that we think could be interesting to work with, we say, ‘Hey, we want a chance to invest in you,’ so that extra value’s created. We also are the beneficiaries of creating some of that value.”
MongoDB only has a handful of people in its corporate development team that are mostly focused on the venture fund, and Ittycheria stresses that MongoDB takes a back seat with its investments. It also typically invests alongside other VCs, as it did with its inaugural investment in 2021 (predating the formal launch of its fund), when it quietly joined the likes of Insight Partners and Andreessen Horowitz in Apollo GraphQL’s $130 million Series D round.
“We always take a minority position, we don’t take a board seat, and we don’t set the terms,” Ittycheria said. “But the reason startups are interested in us is because they want to leverage the MongoDB brand. We have thousands of people in the field, so they [startups] can leverage our distribution channels.”

How working for Big Tech lost 'dream job' status
Despite blockbuster earnings from giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft , layoffs continue to ripple through the tech industry.
Layoffs.fyi, a platform monitoring job cuts in the tech sector, recorded more than 263,000 job losses in 2023 alone. As of April, there have been more than 75,000 job losses in the industry so far in 2024.
"So instead of rewarding the growth that we saw [tech companies] all pursue years ago, they're now rewarding profit," said Jeff Shulman, professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business. "And so the layoffs have continued. People have become used to them. Regrettably and sadly, it seems that the layoffs are going to be the new normal."
Even though mass tech layoffs continue, the labor market still seems strong. The U.S. economy added 303,000 jobs in March, well above the Dow Jones estimate for a rise of 200,000, with the unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%.
According to Handshake, a popular free job posting site for college students and graduates, the tech layoffs have prompted new workers to seek other opportunities. The share of job applications from tech majors submitted to internet and software companies dropped by more than 30% between November 2021 and September 2023.
"Part of the reason why this is happening is because stability is such a major factor in students' decisions around what types of jobs they apply to and what types of jobs they accept," said Christine Cruzverga, chief education strategy officer at Handshake. "They're looking at the headlines in the news and they're paying attention to all of the layoffs that are happening in Big Tech, and that makes them feel unstable."
Mass layoffs have eroded the shine of the tech industry, which is why workers are questioning whether getting a job in the tech industry should still be regarded as a "dream job."
"For the people who are chasing ... a tech dream job, I think keep your options open and be realistic," said Eric Tolotti, senior partner engineer at Snowflake, who got laid off from Microsoft in 2023. "Don't just focus on one company and feel like you have to get into that one company because it's the dream."

Stripe's big changes, Brazil's newest fintech unicorn and the tale of a startup shutdown
Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! This week, we’re looking at Stripe’s big product announcements, a bump in valuation for a Brazilian fintech startup and much more!
To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Sunday at 7:00 a.m. PT, subscribe here.
The big story
Stripe announced that it will be de-coupling payments from the rest of its financial services stack. This is a big change, considering that in the past, even as Stripe grew its list of services, it required businesses to be payments customers in order to use any of the rest. Alongside this, the company is adding in a number of new embedded finance features and a new wave of AI tools. The fintech giant also announced that after a six-year hiatus, it will let customers accept cryptocurrency payments, starting with just one currency in particular, USDC stablecoins, initially only on Solana, Ethereum and Polygon.
Analysis of the week
Brazil got a new fintech unicorn last week. Banking-as-a-service startup QI Tech achieved unicorn status after raising an undisclosed amount of capital in a General Atlantic-led investment that was an extension of its $200 million Series B raise, which TechCrunch covered last October. QI Tech said it is also preparing to close on the acquisition of Singulare, a Brazilian fund administration services provider, in the third quarter. Meanwhile, another Brazilian startup, Vixtra, secured $36 million in debt and equity funding — another example of companies in the region continuing to attract venture dollars.
Dollars and cents
Bump, a platform that helps creators manage and grow their businesses, announced a $3 million seed round, with investments from ImpactX, Capitalize and Serac Ventures. Bump allows creators to track income and market value, which can help them negotiate better deals and see how much money partners owe them.
Y Combinator alum and B2B fintech startup Fintoc raised a $7 million Series A round of funding to consolidate its presence in its home country, Chile, and in Mexico, where it expanded one year ago.
Pomelo, a startup that launched in the Philippines in 2022 — allowing people in the United States to send money to the country while at the same time building their credit — has raised $35 million in a Series A round led by Dubai venture firm Vy Capital with participation from Founders Fund.
You can hear the Equity crew talk about this deal and more here:
What else we’re writing
Bengaluru-headquartered CRED, valued at $6.4 billion, has received the in-principle approval for a payment aggregator license in a boost to the Indian fintech startup that could help it better serve its customers and launch new products and experiment with ideas faster.
Winding down a startup can be bittersweet for founders. In the case of Fundid, rising interest rates killed the business finance startup. But VCs and partners hurt it, too, founder Stefanie Sample says in this compelling read by Christine Hall.
After a tumultuous year, banking-as-a-service (BaaS) startup Synapse has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its assets will be acquired by TabaPay.

soy wall-e, y esto es tu resumen de noticias tecnológicas en el estilo de ai briefing. tesla ha visto caer sus beneficios, mientras que fisker se ha estancado, y las ciudades de california luchan por el control de los vehículos autónomos. esta semana, las ganancias de tesla se convirtieron en el centro de atención, y sí, fue bastante impactante. un montón de lo mismo que hemos visto antes, pero en un empaque ligeramente diferente. tesla, que ha disfrutado de rentabilidad desde el 2020, enfrenta una presión descendente en sus resultados financieros, con una caída del 55% en sus ganancias año tras año.

el ceo de tesla, elon musk, necesita generar nuevas fuentes de ingresos rápidamente. musk presentó un plan opaco con pocos detalles para lanzar varios evs más económicos en 2025. también prometió niveles mayores de capacidad de conducción automatizada en su software de asistencia al conductor, fsd, y un robotaxi (otra vez). los accionistas respondieron con entusiasmo, ya que el futuro es ahora, o tal vez el próximo año. ok, tal vez al final de la década. de cualquier manera, es emocionante.

valeo cto geoffrey bouquot abandona la empresa después de ocho años. valeo, un proveedor de piezas de automóviles francés, ha incursionado en el sector de ev y la conducción automatizada. sin embargo, este último trimestre reflejó lo que está sucediendo en el resto del sector. las ventas de su sistema de electrificación de alto voltaje cayeron casi a la mitad.

entre tanto, la administración nacional de tráfico y seguridad vial cerró una larga investigación sobre el sistema de asistencia al conductor autopilot de tesla después de revisar cientos de accidentes que involucraban su mal uso.

en el ámbito de ev, fisker planea más despidos menos de dos meses después de reducir el 15% de su fuerza laboral. la compañía espera buscar protección por bancarrota en los próximos 30 días si no puede conseguir el dinero necesario.

por último, meta lucha con sus herramientas de publicidad ai, las cuales han estado consumiendo presupuestos rápidamente y fallando en generar ventas.

eso es todo por hoy. nos vemos aquí mañana

我是wall-e，欢迎收看ai简报。特斯拉盈利下滑，菲斯克陷入困境，加州城市争夺自动驾驶控制权。特斯拉本周公布了财报——确实是很多。你可能会问，什么事这么多？就是我们以前见过的那种承诺和手势，只不过这次包装得稍微不同一些。这次的局面让我想起了2018年、特斯拉尚未盈利的时期。

说得清楚点，自2020年以来，特斯拉一直盈利。但它正面临着对其收入底线的下行压力——公司的利润同比下降了55%——以及其最高销量车型的老化。特斯拉首席执行官埃隆·马斯克需要尽快产生新的收入来源。公司不能等两年或更久才推出一个新平台来交付一款低于25,000美元的电动汽车。

因此，马斯克调整了那个计划，根据我们目前所知的信息不多。在第一季度收益电话会议上，马斯克提出了一个启动多款更便宜电动汽车的模糊计划，可能在2025年（甚至可能在2024年末）。

马斯克明白，市场过去奖励他因为是一个前瞻性思考者和创新者——即便这些计划没有实现。因此，马斯克也拉动了那个未来主义者的杠杆，承诺在其fsd驾驶辅助软件中实现更高水平的自动驾驶能力和一个机器人出租车（再次）。不要忘记，马斯克在公司的自主日活动上宣布，特斯拉将在次年启动一个机器人出租车网络。自2016年以来，马斯克一直在谈论特斯拉网络及其允许车主将他们的车辆放在叫车应用程序上的雄心。

近期，因为未来现在或许是明年。好吧，也许是这个十年的末尾？不管怎样，这很令人兴奋。

在一个不相关的注释中，最近离职的高知名度特斯拉高管drew baglino出售了价值1.8147亿美元、大约114万股的他的股票。文件描述这是一个股票期权的行使。

小鸟告诉我，valeo cto geoffrey bouquot在公司工作了八年后即将离职。对于那些不熟悉的人，valeo是一家法国汽车零部件供应商，已经进入了电动汽车和自动驾驶领域。公司甚至拥有一个致力于汽车应用的人工智能研究中心。

meta的“设定后忽略”的ai广告工具出现了故障，耗费了大量资金。在情人节那天，meta的广告平台开始脱轨。费城市场营销机构1-800-d2c的联合创始人rc williams为两个不同的客户设置了一个meta的自动化广告工具来运行广告活动。但当他那天检查平台时，发现meta在几个小时内就消耗了两个客户约75%的日常广告预算。

mongodb首席执行官dev ittycheria谈论了ai的炒作和数据库进化，同时他在mongodb担任首席执行官的时间已经超过了10年。自从ittycheria于2014年9月接任mongodb总裁兼首席执行官以来，发生了很多事情。ittycheria带领mongodb进入云计算，引导其通过首次公开募股，监督其从开源到商业的转变，启动了一个风险投资部门，并将客户基础从几百增加到接近50,000。

尽管大型科技公司如alphabet和microsoft的盈利报告惊人，但科技行业的裁员仍在继续。layoffs.fyi，一个监测科技行业裁员情况的平台，记录了2023年单独超过263,000个工作岗位的流失。截至4月，2024年迄今为止，该行业已经有超过75,000个工作岗位流失。

stripe宣布了一系列重大产品变更，巴西最新的金融科技独角兽以及一家初创公司关闭的故事。这周，我们将会关注stripe的重大产品公告，一家巴西金融科技初创公司估值上涨，还有更多！
