Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday September 2), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nInvestors are already valuing OpenAI at over $100B on the secondaries market\ndescription0:\nOpenAI is in talks to raise a new round of funding at an eye-popping $100 billion-plus valuation, sources told The Wall Street Journal this week.\nIt turns out investors have already proven they are willing to value the company that high to get on OpenAI\u2019s coveted cap table. Multiple companies that track or facilitate secondaries deals \u2014 where investors buy shares from existing investors, not directly from the company \u2014 have seen investors pay prices that indicate an over $100 billion valuation.\nThe primary deal that OpenAI is negotiating would reportedly be led by Josh Kushner\u2019s Thrive Capital, which would put in $1 billion, according to Journal reporting, with Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple, being rumored as investors as well. This would be quite the step up for the AI leader. The company was most recently valued at $86 billion in a secondary sale involving existing stakes in September, Bloomberg reported.\nStill, securities trader Rainmaker Securities has seen investors bidding on OpenAI stock at prices that value the company up to $143 billion. Caplight, a secondary data tracking platform, estimates that the company is currently worth more than $111 billion based on both secondaries activity and past traditional financing rounds.\n\u201cThere are a lot of investors that really want to be part of this story and want to be an investor in this company,\u201d Glen Anderson, co-founder and managing partner at Rainmaker Securities, told TechCrunch. \u201cSo a $100 billion valuation, is it rich? Maybe. But, I mean, if OpenAI can live up to [its] potential, it may be a steal.\u201d\nGreg Martin, a co-founder and managing director at Rainmaker Securities, added that while the company valuation has risen quickly, so has its revenue. While OpenAI still reportedly burns a ton of cash, he said it\u2019s worth noting that the company went from having $0 in revenue just a few years ago to having billions today. The company is tracking to hit $2 billion in ARR by the end of the year, according to The Information.\n\u201cObviously it is hard to put a proper valuation on OpenAI, but we are seeing a lot of demand,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThere is a fear of missing out on the premium the company is getting. There is certainly a cogent argument that the company could be worth a trillion dollars some day.\u201d\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s next official valuation is still yet to be determined, one thing is already for sure \u2014 this funding round will spark more secondaries activity around OpenAI and other AI competitors, Martin said. He predicts it will also give a valuation boost to companies including Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face and more.\n\u201cIt generates buzz. It generates excitement. It resets market expectations,\u201d Martin said.\n\ntitle1:\nTop court orders ban on Elon Musk's X in Brazil\ndescription1:\nA top court in Brazil ordered an immediate, country-wide suspension of the X platform on Friday after a months-long legal battle with Elon Musk\u2019s social media company over content moderation, according to Bloomberg.\nThe court added that anyone using VPN to access the X platform would be subject to daily fines of 50,000 reais \u2014 $8,900 \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear how it would enforce the decree.\nEarlier this month, X closed its operations in Brazil in protest against court orders asking it to remove accounts that allegedly spread misinformation. At the time, the company said Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes \u201cthreatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders.\u201d Moraes warned X earlier this week that Brazil would ban the service if the company did not name a legal representative in the country.\n\u201cSoon, we expect Judge Alexandre de Moraes will order X to be shut down in Brazil, simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents,\u201d said X\u2019s global affairs team in a tweet Friday morning.\nThe platform says it will publish the Brazilian top court\u2019s demands in the coming days and will not comply with its orders.\n\ntitle2:\nCalifornia\u2019s legislature just passed AI bill SB 1047; here\u2019s why some hope the governor won\u2019t sign it\ndescription2:\nUpdate: California\u2019s Appropriations Committee passed SB 1047 with significant amendments that change the bill on Thursday, August 15. You can read about them here.\nOutside of sci-fi films, there\u2019s no precedent for AI systems killing people or being used in massive cyberattacks. However, some lawmakers want to implement safeguards before bad actors make that dystopian future a reality. A California bill, known as SB 1047, tries to stop real-world disasters caused by AI systems before they happen. It passed the state\u2019s senate in August, and now awaits an approval or veto from California Governor Gavin Newsom.\nWhile this seems like a goal we can all agree on, SB 1047 has drawn the ire of Silicon Valley players large and small, including venture capitalists, big tech trade groups, researchers and startup founders. A lot of AI bills are flying around the country right now, but California\u2019s Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act has become one of the most controversial. Here\u2019s why.\nWhat would SB 1047 do?\nSB 1047 tries to prevent large AI models from being used to cause \u201ccritical harms\u201d against humanity.\nThe bill gives examples of \u201ccritical harms\u201d as a bad actor using an AI model to create a weapon that results in mass casualties, or instructing one to orchestrate a cyberattack causing more than $500 million in damages (for comparison, the CrowdStrike outage is estimated to have caused upwards of $5 billion). The bill makes developers \u2014 that is, the companies that develop the models \u2014 liable for implementing sufficient safety protocols to prevent outcomes like these.\nWhat models and companies are subject to these rules?\nSB 1047\u2019s rules would only apply to the world\u2019s largest AI models: ones that cost at least $100 million and use 10^26 FLOPS (floating point operations, a way of measuring computation) during training. That\u2019s a huge amount of compute, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said GPT-4 cost about this much to train. These thresholds could be raised as needed.\nVery few companies today have developed public AI products large enough to meet those requirements, but tech giants such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are likely to very soon. AI models \u2014 essentially, massive statistical engines that identify and predict patterns in data \u2014 have generally become more accurate as they\u2019ve grown larger, a trend many expect to continue. Mark Zuckerberg recently said the next generation of Meta\u2019s Llama will require 10x more compute, which would put it under the authority of SB 1047.\nWhen it comes to open source models and their derivatives, the bill determined the original developer is responsible unless another developer spends another $10 million creating a derivative of the original model.\nThe bill also requires a safety protocol to prevent misuses of covered AI products, including an \u201cemergency stop\u201d button that shuts down the entire AI model. Developers must also create testing procedures that address risks posed by AI models, and must hire third-party auditors annually to assess their AI safety practices.\nThe result must be \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that following these protocols will prevent critical harms \u2014 not absolute certainty, which is of course impossible to provide.\nWho would enforce it, and how?\nA new California agency, the Board of Frontier Models, would oversee the rules. Every new public AI model that meets SB 1047\u2019s thresholds must be individually certified with a written copy of its safety protocol.\nThe Board of Frontier Models, would be governed by nine people, including representatives from the AI industry, open source community and academia, appointed by California\u2019s governor and legislature. The board will advise California\u2019s attorney general on potential violations of SB 1047, and issue guidance to AI model developers on safety practices.\nA developer\u2019s chief technology officer must submit an annual certification to the board assessing its AI model\u2019s potential risks, how effective its safety protocol is and a description of how the company is complying with SB 1047. Similar to breach notifications, if an \u201cAI safety incident\u201d occurs, the developer must report it to the FMD within 72 hours of learning about the incident.\nIf a developer\u2019s safety measures are found insufficient, SB 1047 allows California\u2019s attorney general to bring an injunctive order against the developer. That could mean the developer would have to cease operating or training its model.\nIf an AI model is actually found to be used in a catastrophic event, California\u2019s attorney general can sue the company. For a model costing $100 million to train, penalties could reach up to $10 million on the first violation and $30 million on subsequent violations. That penalty rate scales as AI models become more expensive.\nLastly, the bill includes whistleblower protections for employees if they try to disclose information about an unsafe AI model to California\u2019s attorney general.\nWhat do proponents say?\nCalifornia State Senator Scott Wiener, who authored the bill and represents San Francisco, tells TechCrunch that SB 1047 is an attempt to learn from past policy failures with social media and data privacy, and protect citizens before it\u2019s too late.\n\u201cWe have a history with technology of waiting for harms to happen, and then wringing our hands,\u201d said Wiener. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait for something bad to happen. Let\u2019s just get out ahead of it.\u201d\nEven if a company trains a $100 million model in Texas, or for that matter France, it will be covered by SB 1047 as long as it does business in California. Wiener says Congress has done \u201cremarkably little legislating around technology over the last quarter century,\u201d so he thinks it\u2019s up to California to set a precedent here.\nWhen asked whether he\u2019s met with OpenAI and Meta on SB 1047, Wiener says \u201cwe\u2019ve met with all the large labs.\u201d\nTwo AI researchers who are sometimes called the \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have thrown their support behind this bill. These two belong to a faction of the AI community concerned about the dangerous, doomsday scenarios that AI technology could cause. These \u201cAI doomers\u201d have existed for a while in the research world, and SB 1047 could codify some of their preferred safeguards into law. Another group sponsoring SB 1047, the Center for AI Safety, wrote an open letter in May 2023 asking the world to prioritize \u201cmitigating the risk of extinction from AI\u201d as seriously as pandemics or nuclear war.\n\u201cThis is in the long-term interest of industry in California and the US more generally because a major safety incident would likely be the biggest roadblock to further advancement,\u201d said director of the Center for AI Safety, Dan Hendrycks, in an email to TechCrunch.\nRecently, Hendrycks\u2019 own motivations have been called into question. In July, he publicly launched a startup, Gray Swan, which builds \u201ctools to help companies assess the risks of their AI systems,\u201d according to a press release. Following criticisms that Hendrycks\u2019 startup could stand to gain if the bill passes, potentially as one of the auditors SB 1047 requires developers to hire, he divested his equity stake in Gray Swan.\n\u201cI divested in order to send a clear signal,\u201d said Hendrycks in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cIf the billionaire VC opposition to commonsense AI safety wants to show their motives are pure, let them follow suit.\u201d\nAfter several of Anthropic\u2019s suggested amendments were added to SB 1047, CEO Dario Amodei issued a letter saying the bill\u2019s \u201cbenefits likely outweigh its costs.\u201d It\u2019s not an endorsement, but it\u2019s a lukewarm signal of support. Shortly after that, Elon Musk signaled he was in favor of the bill.\nWhat do opponents say?\nA growing chorus of Silicon Valley players oppose SB 1047.\nHendrycks\u2019 \u201cbillionaire VC opposition\u201d likely refers to a16z, the venture firm founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, which has strongly opposed SB 1047. In early August, the venture firm\u2019s chief legal officer, Jaikumar Ramaswamy, submitted a letter to Senator Wiener, claiming the bill \u201cwill burden startups because of its arbitrary and shifting thresholds,\u201d creating a chilling effect on the AI ecosystem. As AI technology advances, it will get more expensive, meaning that more startups will cross that $100 million threshold and will be covered by SB 1047; a16z says several of their startups already receive that much for training models.\nFei-Fei Li, often called the godmother of AI, broke her silence on SB 1047 in early August, writing in a Fortune column that the bill will \u201charm our budding AI ecosystem.\u201d While Li is a well-regarded pioneer in AI research from Stanford, she also reportedly created an AI startup called World Labs in April, valued at a billion dollars and backed by a16z.\nShe joins influential AI academics such as fellow Stanford researcher Andrew Ng, who called the bill \u201can assault on open source\u201d during a speech at a Y Combinator event in July. Open source models may create additional risk for their creators, since like any open software, they are more easily modified and deployed to arbitrary and potentially malicious purposes.\nMeta\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, said SB 1047 would hurt research efforts, and is based on an \u201cillusion of \u2018existential risk\u2019 pushed by a handful of delusional think-tanks,\u201d in a post on X. Meta\u2019s Llama LLM is one of the foremost examples of an open source LLM.\nStartups are also not happy about the bill. Jeremy Nixon, CEO of AI startup Omniscience and founder of AGI House SF, a hub for AI startups in San Francisco, worries that SB 1047 will crush his ecosystem. He argues that bad actors should be punished for causing critical harms, not the AI labs that openly develop and distribute the technology.\n\u201cThere is a deep confusion at the center of the bill, that LLMs can somehow differ in their levels of hazardous capability,\u201d said Nixon. \u201cIt\u2019s more than likely, in my mind, that all models have hazardous capabilities as defined by the bill.\u201d\nOpenAI opposed SB 1047 in late August, noting that national security measures related to AI models should be regulated at the federal level. They\u2019ve supported a federal bill that would do so.\nBut Big Tech, which the bill directly focuses on, is panicked about SB 1047 as well. The Chamber of Progress \u2014 a trade group representing Google, Apple, Amazon and other Big Tech giants \u2014 issued an open letter opposing the bill saying SB 1047 restrains free speech and \u201cpushes tech innovation out of California.\u201d Last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other tech executives endorsed the idea of federal AI regulation.\nU.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, released a statement opposing SB 1047 in August. He expressed concerns the bill \u201cwould be ineffective, punishing of individual entrepreneurs and small businesses, and hurt California\u2019s spirit of innovation.\u201d He\u2019s since been joined by speaker Nancy Pelosi and the United States Chamber of Commerce, who have also said the bill would hurt innovation.\nSilicon Valley doesn\u2019t traditionally like when California sets broad tech regulation like this. In 2019, Big Tech pulled a similar card when another state privacy bill, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act, also threatened to change the tech landscape. Silicon Valley lobbied against that bill, and months before it went into effect, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and 50 other executives wrote an open letter calling for a federal privacy bill instead.\nWhat happens next?\nSB 1047 currently sits on California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk where he will ultimately decide whether to sign the bill into law before the end of August. Wiener says he has not spoken to Newsom about the bill, and does not know his position.\nThis bill would not go into effect immediately, as the Board of Frontier Models is set to be formed in 2026. Further, if the bill does pass, it\u2019s very likely to face legal challenges before then, perhaps from some of the same groups that are speaking up about it now.\nCorrection: This story originally referenced a previous draft of SB 1047\u2019s language around who is responsible for fine-tuned models. Currently, SB 1047 says the developer of a derivative model is only responsible for a model if they spend three times as much as the original model developer did on training.\n\ntitle3:\nMongoDB (MDB) Q2 earnings report 2025\ndescription3:\nMongoDB shares jumped as much as 16% in extended trading Thursday after the database software maker reported healthy fiscal second-quarter earnings and pushed up full-year guidance.\nHere's how the company did against LSEG consensus:\nEarnings per share: 70 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected\n70 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected Revenue: $478.1 million vs. $464.1 million\nMongoDB's revenue grew 13% year over year in the quarter that ended July 31, according to a statement. The quarter's net loss came to $54.5 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $37.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\"We believe we are incredibly well positioned to help customers incorporate generative AI into their business and modernize their legacy application estate,\" CEO Dev Ittycheria said in the statement.\nThe company's Atlas cloud database service enjoyed modestly better consumption than expected, he said on a conference call with analysts.\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Atlas consumption growth slowed as clients observed more challenging economic conditions, and usage in the fiscal second quarter implied that the climate did not change, Ittycheria said.\n\"We generally have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business, and that was true in Q2 as well,\" Ittycheria said. \"We realized that this is different from what you hear from some other software vendors.\"\nOn Thursday Ash Kulkarni, CEO of search software maker Elastic , said the volume of client commitments it closed in its fiscal first quarter was below plan. That stock was down 23% after hours. During the MongoDB call, Ittycheria talked about helping companies migrate from Elastic products.\nWith respect to guidance, MongoDB called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents per share on $493.0 million to $497.0 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 60 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.\nManagement nudged up its fiscal 2025 forecast. MongoDB now sees $2.33 to $2.47 per share in adjusted earnings, with $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion in revenue. That's up from the May guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion in revenue. Analysts had predicted $2.26 per share in adjusted earnings, along with $1.90 billion in revenue.\nExcluding the after-hours move, MongoDB shares were down almost 40% on the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% in the same period.\n\ntitle4:\nDell earnings report Q2 2025\ndescription4:\nMichael Dell at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 12, 2024 in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nDell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 3% in extended trading.\nHere's how the company did for the fiscal second quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:\nRevenue: $25.03 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected\n$25.03 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected EPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected\nNet income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.\nThe stock took a leg lower after Dell revised its full-year revenue guidance to between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion, a slight upward revision from the company's previous forecast. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.\nFor the current quarter, Dell said it expected between $24 billion and $25 billion in revenue, in line with the StreetAccount estimate of $24.6 billion.\nDell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company's new chips.\nDell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company's last report.\nAI sales are in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It's the company's fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.\nThe standout in Dell's report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It's part of ISG.\n\"We are competing in all of the big AI deals and are winning significant deployments at scale,\" the company's operating chief, Jeff Clarke, said on an earnings call with analysts.\nThe unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.\nClarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said that there was an increasing \"backlog\" of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven't been fulfilled yet. There's also a multibillion-dollar \"pipeline\" of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven't been finalized.\nHowever, Dell's storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.\nDell's Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company's enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.\nDell said it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.\nCorrection: Dell reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $25.03 billion. An earlier version misstated the figure.\"\n\nResponse:",
