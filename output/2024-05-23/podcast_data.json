The company's data center revenue grew by a whopping 427% during the quarter.\nShares closed above $1,000 for the first time, reaching a high of $1,037.99. Its previous high of $953.86 was set on May 21.\nFirst-quarter revenue came in higher than expected at $26.04 billion compared with the LSEG estimate of $24.65 billion. And the demand isn't wavering.\nThe company issued strong guidance, saying it expects $28 billion in revenue for the current quarter, beating the LSEG estimate of $26.61 billion.\nDespite some analysts fearing an \"air pocket,\" others have grown even more bullish on the company since its results. Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon increased the firm's price target to $1,300, writing in a note to investors that the narrative surrounding the company is \"clearly nowhere near its end, or likely nowhere near its peak.\" He wrote that shares seem inexpensive.\nJefferies raised its target on the stock to $1,350 due to a strong ramp for its new AI graphics processors called Blackwell and anticipation of an acceleration in \"magnitude of beats\" later this year when the platform launches.\nNvidia posted net income of $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share, a dramatic pop from the $2.04 billion, or 82 cents per share, it reported in the year-ago quarter.\nNvidia on Wednesday announced a 10-for-1 stock split, with shares set to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on June 10.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia shows no sign of AI slowdown after data center soars over 400%\ndescription1:\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in San Jose, California, US, on Tuesday, March 19, 2024.\nNvidia 's historic rally is being driven by its data center business, which grew at a whopping 427% in the latest quarter as companies keep snapping up its artificial intelligence processors.\nNow, Nvidia is signaling to investors that the customers spending billions of dollars on its chips will be able to make money off AI, too. It's a concern that's been swirling around the company because there's only so much cash clients can burn on infrastructure before they need to see some profit.\nIf Nvidia's chips can provide a strong and sustainable return on investment, that suggests the AI boom may have room to run as it moves past the early stages of development, and as companies plan for longer-term projects.\nNvidia's most important clients for its graphics processing units are the big cloud providers \u2014 Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. They made up \"mid-40%\" of Nvidia's $22.56 billion in data center sales in the April quarter, the company said.\nThere's also a newer crop of specialized GPU data center startups that buy Nvidia's GPUs, install them in server racks, load them up in data centers, connect them to the internet, and then rent them out to customers by the hour.\nFor example, CoreWeave, a GPU cloud, is currently quoting $4.25 per hour to rent an Nvidia H100. This kind of server time is essential in large quantities to train a large language model such as OpenAI's GPT, and it's how many AI developers end up accessing Nvidia hardware.\nFollowing Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday, finance chief Colette Kress told investors that cloud providers were seeing an \"immediate and strong return\" on investment. She said that if a cloud provider spends $1 on Nvidia hardware, it can rent it out for $5 over the next four years.\nKress also said newer Nvidia hardware would have an even stronger return on investment, citing the company's HDX H200 product, which combines 8 GPUs, providing access to Meta's Llama AI model, instead of raw access to a cloud computer.\n\"That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HDX H200 servers at current prices, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years,\" Kress said.\nPart of the calculation includes how the chips are utilized, whether they are running 24 hours a day or less frequently.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the earnings call that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and as many as 20,000 generative AI startups are lining up for every GPU the cloud providers can put online.\n\"All of the work that's being done at all the [cloud service providers] are consuming every GPU that's out there,\" Huang said. \"Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible.\"\nHuang said Meta has declared its intention to spend billions on 350,000 Nvidia chips, even though the company isn't a cloud provider. Facebook parent Meta will likely have to monetize its investment through its advertising business or by including a chatbot inside its current apps.\nMeta's cluster of servers is an example of \"essential infrastructure for AI production,\" Huang said, or, \"what we refer to as AI factories.\"\nNvidia also surprised analysts by giving an aggressive timeline for its next-generation GPU, called Blackwell, which will be available in data centers in the fiscal fourth quarter. Those comments allayed fears of a slowdown as companies wait for the latest technology.\nThe first customers for the new chips include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla , and Elon Musk's xAI, Huang said.\nNvidia shares jumped 6% in extended trading, surpassing $1,000 for the first time. In addition to announcing earnings, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split following a 25-fold surge in the company's share price over the past five years.\n\ntitle2:\nBig Tech goes on AI charm offensive in Europe as regulators circle\ndescription2:\nRafael Henrique | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nPARIS, France \u2014 U.S. technology giants this week have talked up the benefits of artificial intelligence for humanity, turning on the charm at one of Europe's largest industry events as regulators globally work to curb the harms associated with the tech. At the Viva Tech conference in Paris on Wednesday, Amazon Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels and Google Senior Vice President for Technology and Society James Manyika spoke about the great potential AI is unlocking for economies and communities. It's worth noting that their comments come as the world's first major law governing AI, the EU's AI Act, was given the final greenlight. Regulators are looking to rein in harms and abuses of the technology, such as misinformation and copyright abuse. Meanwhile, European Commissioner Thierry Breton, a major architect of rules around Big Tech, is set to speak later in the week. Vogels, who is tasked with driving technology innovation within Amazon , said that AI can be used to \"solve some of the world's hardest problems.\" He said that, while AI has the potential to make businesses of all stripes successfully, \"at the same time we need responsibly to use some of this technology to solve some of the world's hardest problems.\" Vogels said that it was important to talk about \"AI for now\" \u2014 in other words, the ways that the technology can benefit populations around the world currently.\nwatch now\nHe mentioned examples of how AI is being used in Jakarta, Indonesia, to link small rice farm owners to financial services. AI could also be used to build up a more efficient supply chain for rice, which he termed \"the most important staple of food,\" with 50% of the planet dependent on rice as their main food source. Manyika, who oversees efforts across Google and Alphabet on responsible innovation, said that AI can lead to huge benefits from a health and biotechnology standpoint. He said a version of Google's Gemini AI model recently released by the firm is tailored for medical applications and able to understand context relating to the medical domain. Google DeepMind, the key unit behind the firm's AI efforts, also released a new version of its AlphaFold 3 AI model that can understand \"all of life's molecules, not just proteins,\" and that it has made this technology available to researchers. Manyika also called out innovations the company announced at its recent Google I/O event in Mountain View, California, including new \"watermarking\" technology for identifying text that's been generated by AI, as well as images and audio which it's launched previously.\nManyika said Google open-sourced its watermarking tech so that any developer can \"build on it, improve on it.\" \"I think it's going to take all of us, these are some of the things, especially in a year like this, a billion people around the world have voted, so concerns around misinformation are important,\" Manyika said. \"These are some of the things we should be focused on.\" Manyika also stressed that a lot of the innovation that Google has been bringing to the table has been sourced from engineers at its French hub, stressing it's committed to sourcing much of its innovation from within the European Union. He said that Google's recently introduced Gemma AI, a lightweight, open-source model, was developed heavily at the U.S. internet giant's French tech hub.\nEU regulators set global rules\nManyika's comments arrived just a day after the EU approved the AI Act, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that sets comprehensive rules governing artificial intelligence. The AI Act applies a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on the perceived threats they pose. \"I worry sometimes when all our narratives are just focused on the risks,\" Manyika said. \"Those are very important, but we should also be thinking about, why are we building this technology?\"\nwatch now\n\"All of the developers in the room are thinking about, how do we improve society, how do we build businesses, how do we do imaginative, innovative things that solve some of the world's problems.\" He said that Google is committed to balancing innovation with \"being responsible,\" and \"being thoughtful, about will this harm people in any way, will this benefit people in any way, and how we keep on researching these things.\" Major U.S. tech firms have been trying to win favor with regulators as they face criticisms over their massive businesses having an adverse effect on smaller companies in areas ranging from advertising to retail to media production. Specifically, with the advent of AI, opponents of Big Tech are concerned of the growing threats of new advanced generative AI systems undermining jobs, exploiting copyrighted material for training data, and producing misinformation and harmful content.\nFriends in high places\nBig Tech has been looking to curry favor with French officials. Last week, at the \"Choose France\" foreign investment summit, Microsoft and Amazon signed commitments to invest a combined 5.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of funding for cloud and AI infrastructure and jobs in France. This week, French President Emmanuel Macron met with Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist of Meta, and Google's Manyika, among other tech leaders, at the Elysee Palace to discuss ways of making Paris a global AI hub.\nwatch now\nIn a statement issued by the Elysee, and translated into English via Google Translate, Macron welcomed leaders from various tech firms to France and thanked them for their \"commitment to France to be there at Viva Tech.\" Macron said that the \"pride is mine to have you here as talents\" in the global AI sphere. Matt Calkins, CEO of U.S. enterprise software firm Appian, told CNBC that large tech firms \"have a disproportionate influence on the development and deployment of AI technologies.\" \"I am concerned that there is potential for monopolies to emerge around Big Tech and AI,\" he said. \"They can train their models on privately-owned data \u2014 as long as they anonymize it. This isn't enough.\" \"We need more privacy than this if we use individual and business data,\" Calkins added.\n\ntitle3:\nTesla CEO Elon Musk says he favors 'no tariffs' on Chinese EVs\ndescription3:\nElon Musk, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X Holdings Corp., speaks at the Milken Institute's Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel,on May 6, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.\nPARIS\u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he doesn't support President Biden's recent announcement of a tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\"Neither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs,\" Musk said in response to a question from CNBC's Karen Tso during a question and answer session at the VivaTech conference here on Thursday. \"In fact, I was surprised when they were announced.\"\nThe Biden administration last week said it was placing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicle imports to the U.S. in a bid to stop cheap Chinese EVs from flooding the U.S. market. The White House says Beijing's subsidies are helping companies overproduce cheap clean energy products like solar panels and EVs that outpace domestic demand.\nTesla has been struggling this year due to an aging fleet of EVs, weaker consumer demand for its vehicles and increased global competition, most notably in China. Revenue slumped in the first quarter by the most since 2012, and the stock price is down almost 30% in 2024.\n\"Tesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support,\" Musk said on Thursday. \"I'm in favor of no tariffs.\"\nMusk added that he doesn't agree with tax incentives for EVs, either.\n\"I'm in favor of no tariffs and no incentives for electric vehicles, or for oil and gas,\" the Tesla CEO said.\nMusk's remarks Thursday come after he suggested earlier this year that Chinese EV companies will crush competitors elsewhere in the absence of trade restrictions.\n\"Frankly, I think, if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world,\" Musk said on the company's earnings call in January.\nEarlier, when asked for his views on whether Biden's 100% tariffs would give him to the green light to bring a lower-priced car to market, Musk's line cut out and the audience were left for several minutes waiting for him to come back online.\nSome attendees left the dome where the Q&A session was being livestreamed.\n\ntitle4:\nCanva launches a proper enterprise product \u2014 and they mean it this time\ndescription4:\nBack in 2019, Canva, the wildly successful design tool, introduced what the company was calling an enterprise product, but in reality it was more geared toward teams than fulfilling true enterprise requirements. On Thursday, the company changed that, announcing a new enterprise version that is truly geared toward the needs of larger organizations.\nThat includes the types of features that you would expect in this kind of product, including single sign-on, enhanced security offerings and tools for managing larger groups of users that IT would expect. It also offers centralized brand management and dedicated support.\nCam Adams, co-founder and CPO at the company, says in 2019, they were looking at moving from supporting mostly individual users to supporting small teams from between five and 100 users. Over the intervening years, they began seeing much larger organizations using Canva, and recognized that they needed a product more geared toward the requirements of these larger companies.\n\u201cWe now have cohorts with up to 5,000 people using Canva inside an enterprise, and because of that, there\u2019s a new type of Canva enterprise product that we\u2019ve needed to ship to meet the needs of those larger groups. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve actually done with Canva Enterprise,\u201d Adams told TechCrunch.\nThis version is trying to address three specific problems Canva saw as it moved into larger organizations.\nFor starters, design isn\u2019t confined to one group anymore. It spans multiple departments and industries. Secondly, there are myriad AI tools and Adams says he\u2019s seeing CIOs becoming increasingly wary of \u201cAI tool creep.\u201d And finally, there is a workflow component. As more departments are involved in the design process, and as AI becomes more prominent, it requires a tool that can handle not just back-end user management, but also moving work across these different constituencies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re no longer just thinking about empowering every person. We\u2019re really thinking about the second decade of Canva being about empowering every organization. And when we think of enterprises, we\u2019re really looking at bringing all that fragmentation together into the one platform,\u201d he said.\nThe prior version of the product is becoming a proper teams product and will cost $100 per seat per year with a three-person minimum. The enterprise pricing starts at $300 per seat per year, but with negotiated volume-based discounts available.\nThe Australian company was founded in 2012 and has raised more than $560 million, most recently at an astonishing $26 billion valuation, per the company.
