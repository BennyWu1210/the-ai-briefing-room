Noah Berger | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\nIn May 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked by an attendee at the annual shareholder meeting how the company was innovating in generative artificial intelligence. OpenAI's ChatGPT had gone viral, and the major tech companies were all rushing products out the door to compete in the emerging world of chatbots and image generators. Jassy responded to the question by touting Amazon Web Services, the cloud unit he'd helped launch 17 years earlier, eventually turning it into the company's main profit engine. AWS, under the leadership of Adam Selipsky, was developing its own AI products, Jassy said, and had the potential to provide critical infrastructure for other companies developing AI services. \"It's very early days in generative AI,\" said Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021. \"It's very high potential, and we're investing quite a bit in it and expect to be a leader.\" For Selipsky, who took over AWS when Jassy was promoted, the days got late quickly. In the most significant shake-up of Jassy's tenure at the helm, Amazon announced last week that Selipsky, 57, was exiting AWS and will be succeeded by Matt Garman, 48, a veteran AWS executive who most recently led sales and marketing. The problem for Selipsky and the challenge for Garman is that Amazon has yet to emerge as a leader in generative AI despite throwing billions of dollars behind OpenAI competitor Anthropic and rolling out its own large language models, or LLMs. In the developer universe and among startups, the company is battling the perception that it's falling behind cloud rivals Microsoft and Google , in addition to lagging OpenAI in developing AI tools. After years of rapid expansion, growth at AWS decelerated to 13% in 2023, down from 37% in 2021 and 29% in 2022, reflecting more conservative spending by businesses on IT and cloud services. Amazon has downsized across the board, including at least two rounds of layoffs at AWS since last year.\nAWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure, but Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. AWS' market share slipped to 31% in the first quarter of this year from 32% three years earlier, while Microsoft Azure jumped to 25% of the market from 19% in 2021, according to Canalys. Google is also picking up share, accounting for 10% of the market, up from 7% in early 2021. In the past few quarters, Microsoft has cited surging demand for AI tools as a catalyst for its momentum. Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told CNBC that Amazon was \"caught flat-footed\" by the generative AI boom. \"It allowed Microsoft Azure to run laps around them, which should not have happened, and ultimately there was a price to pay for that,\" Luria said, referring to Selipsky's departure. Garman's selection for the top job \"indicates Mr. Jassy and perhaps Mr. Bezos believe he's the person most likely to help Amazon close the lead and maybe establish a lead of their own,\" said Luria, who recommends buying Amazon shares.\n'Next generation of leadership'\nA source close to Amazon, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter, described Garman to CNBC as a \"wartime\" leader and said change was needed to get more aggressive in AI. Jassy said in a staff memo announcing the move that he and Selipsky agreed years ago, when they were discussing the role, that Selipsky would \"likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he'd focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership.\" Casey McGee, an AWS spokesperson, told CNBC in a statement that Selipsky is leaving the cloud division in a \"strong position.\" \"The growth, innovation, and profitability of AWS over the past three years speaks for itself, with AWS producing more absolute dollar growth quarter-over-quarter by our numbers so far this year than any other cloud provider,\" McGee said. He said AWS is leading in security and reliability as well as the \"overall breadth and depth of our services.\"\nAmazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky speaks with Anthropic CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei during AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023. Noah Berger | Getty Images\nAmazon's annual shareholder meeting, which took place virtually Wednesday, arrived at a precarious time. It was held just days after Selipsky's departure and was overshadowed by AI-focused events at top tech companies. Last week, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o, a faster model with improved capabilities in text, video and audio. Google followed a day later at its developer conference, rolling out the company's lightest and most efficient AI models. And this week, Microsoft announced new computers with advanced chips designed to run AI features in Windows. During a Q&A session on Wednesday, Jassy was asked twice about the status of Amazon's generative AI efforts. He said the company is \"seeing a lot of momentum\" in generative AI within AWS to where it's now a multibillion-dollar business based on annualized revenue. He reminded shareholders that Amazon owns Alexa, which was a popular consumer offering long before the latest chatbots hit the market. \"If you don't believe there's going to be a really broad personal assistant, you have your head in the sand,\" Jassy said, adding that the company is building a \"much more expansive\" AI model to power Alexa. Amazon has previously said it intends to use generative AI to make Alexa more conversational. CNBC reported on Wednesday that Amazon plans to charge a subscription fee for the more powerful version. Garman joined Amazon in 2005 as an intern, and was hired full time the following year as an early product manager in AWS, working on the core computing service called EC2. He worked his way up to senior vice president in 2020, overseeing sales, marketing and global services. In 2021, after Amazon announced that Jassy would be taking over the CEO role from Bezos, many people speculated that Garman would be named CEO of AWS. Instead, Amazon chose Selipsky, who had previously spent 11 years at Amazon but was running Salesforce's Tableau Software at the time.\nRough patch\nShortly after the transition, the economy turned against AWS. Inflation started to rapidly pick up, leading to a steady rise in interest rates and forcing businesses into capital preservation mode. By mid-2022, Amazon was telling investors that it was \"prepared to help customers optimize their costs\" due to the economic challenges they were facing. AWS acknowledged it was taking a short-term revenue hit to preserve customer relationships over the long term. Then came ChatGPT. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the chatbot in November 2022 and watched it go viral. Months later, Microsoft invested billions more into OpenAI, and became its exclusive cloud partner, giving Amazon's chief cloud rival a new competitive edge. Over the course of the past year, Jassy has gushed about Amazon's opportunities in generative AI, both for offering automated services to advertisers and sellers and in providing technology within AWS for running sophisticated models and workloads. The company has also boasted about the success of AWS' Trainium and Inferentia chips, with Anthropic using them to build and train its models, a process often performed on Nvidia graphics processing units. \"I don't know if any of us has seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure since the cloud, perhaps since the internet,\" Jassy said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in April, speaking about generative AI. But realizing that opportunity is proving to be a major hurdle.\nwatch now\nAWS took months to come out with an AI model that could go up against ChatGPT. The company is now offering its own LLMs as well as those from third parties, including one from Anthropic, which Amazon backed. Last year, Amazon released Q, a chatbot for businesses. An AWS employee, who used Q, told CNBC that it felt underwhelming because the chatbot would respond to queries with information that wasn't particularly relevant or valuable. The employee asked to remain anonymous because he wasn't authorized to speak on the matter. AWS said its Q chatbot has been gaining traction among a range of customers including Accenture, Toyota, GoDaddy and GitLab. Bedrock, which lets users access AI models from Amazon and others, now has tens of thousands of customers and partners, the company said. The week before his departure, Selipsky made some changes to the Q team. He tapped Dilip Kumar, a longtime Amazon executive who helped develop and launch its cashierless checkout technology, to oversee the \"Amazon Q Business set of services,\" according to a memo sent to employees that was viewed by CNBC. Kumar will report to Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of AI and data at AWS. A former AWS employee, who asked not to be named in order to speak about private matters, said the company has limited the ability of some staffers to use AI services like its software tool SageMaker and data visualization tool QuickSight for work internally, citing security reasons. The practice, known as dogfooding, is commonly used at software companies so employees can test products and services for bugs and to help make improvements. AWS said all applications made available to employees are subject to a security review, but it denied that it's restricted staffers' use of Amazon's AI tools. Despite all of its AI challenges, Wall Street continues to rally around Amazon, which last month reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and a more than 200% increase in operating income. Sales at AWS rose 17%, a modest acceleration from the past few quarters. Amazon shares are up 21% this year, topping the 12% gain in the Nasdaq, after jumping 81% in 2023. The stock hit a record earlier this month. Jamie Meyers, a senior investment analyst at Laffer Tengler Investments, which owns shares of Amazon, said he views the leadership transition at AWS as a \"natural progression,\" adding that Garman has \"always been looked at as a successor.\" \"AWS has always been about investing in growth,\" Meyers said, a strategy he said is unlikely to change under Garman. Garman is viewed internally as someone who is highly technical, and is well respected among engineers. At the time Jassy picked Garman to lead the AWS sales organization in 2020, he was looking for a technical leader and a person who \"knew everything inside out,\" another former AWS employee said. Garman's appointment to the role was widely seen internally as a step toward priming him to lead AWS, the person added. In his memo to staffers last week, Jassy referenced Garman's background \"on both the product and demand generation sides\" of AWS, noting he has \"an unusually strong set of skills and experiences for his new role.\" \"I'm excited to see Matt and his outstanding AWS leadership team continue to invent our future,\" Jassy said. \"It's still such early days in AWS.\" \u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet and Kate Rooney contributed to this report. Correction: CNBC reported Wednesday that Amazon plans to charge a subscription fee for a more powerful version of Alexa. An earlier version misstated the day.\n\ntitle2:\nBig Tech goes on AI charm offensive in Europe as regulators circle\ndescription2:\nRafael Henrique | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nPARIS, France \u2014 U.S. technology giants this week have talked up the benefits of artificial intelligence for humanity, turning on the charm at one of Europe's largest industry events as regulators globally work to curb the harms associated with the tech. At the Viva Tech conference in Paris on Wednesday, Amazon Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels and Google Senior Vice President for Technology and Society James Manyika spoke about the great potential AI is unlocking for economies and communities. It's worth noting that their comments come as the world's first major law governing AI, the EU's AI Act, was given the final greenlight. Regulators are looking to rein in harms and abuses of the technology, such as misinformation and copyright abuse. Meanwhile, European Commissioner Thierry Breton, a major architect of rules around Big Tech, is set to speak later in the week. Vogels, who is tasked with driving technology innovation within Amazon , said that AI can be used to \"solve some of the world's hardest problems.\" He said that, while AI has the potential to make businesses of all stripes successfully, \"at the same time we need responsibly to use some of this technology to solve some of the world's hardest problems.\" Vogels said that it was important to talk about \"AI for now\" \u2014 in other words, the ways that the technology can benefit populations around the world currently.\nwatch now\nHe mentioned examples of how AI is being used in Jakarta, Indonesia, to link small rice farm owners to financial services. AI could also be used to build up a more efficient supply chain for rice, which he termed \"the most important staple of food,\" with 50% of the planet dependent on rice as their main food source. Manyika, who oversees efforts across Google and Alphabet on responsible innovation, said that AI can lead to huge benefits from a health and biotechnology standpoint. He said a version of Google's Gemini AI model recently released by the firm is tailored for medical applications and able to understand context relating to the medical domain. Google DeepMind, the key unit behind the firm's AI efforts, also released a new version of its AlphaFold 3 AI model that can understand \"all of life's molecules, not just proteins,\" and that it has made this technology available to researchers. Manyika also called out innovations the company announced at its recent Google I/O event in Mountain View, California, including new \"watermarking\" technology for identifying text that's been generated by AI, as well as images and audio which it's launched previously.\nManyika said Google open-sourced its watermarking tech so that any developer can \"build on it, improve on it.\" \"I think it's going to take all of us, these are some of the things, especially in a year like this, a billion people around the world have voted, so concerns around misinformation are important,\" Manyika said. \"These are some of the things we should be focused on.\" Manyika also stressed that a lot of the innovation that Google has been bringing to the table has been sourced from engineers at its French hub, stressing it's committed to sourcing much of its innovation from within the European Union. He said that Google's recently introduced Gemma AI, a lightweight, open-source model, was developed heavily at the U.S. internet giant's French tech hub.\nEU regulators set global rules\nManyika's comments arrived just a day after the EU approved the AI Act, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that sets comprehensive rules governing artificial intelligence. The AI Act applies a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on the perceived threats they pose. \"I worry sometimes when all our narratives are just focused on the risks,\" Manyika said. \"Those are very important, but we should also be thinking about, why are we building this technology?\"\nwatch now\n\"All of the developers in the room are thinking about, how do we improve society, how do we build businesses, how do we do imaginative, innovative things that solve some of the world's problems.\" He said that Google is committed to balancing innovation with \"being responsible,\" and \"being thoughtful, about will this harm people in any way, will this benefit people in any way, and how we keep on researching these things.\" Major U.S. tech firms have been trying to win favor with regulators as they face criticisms over their massive businesses having an adverse effect on smaller companies in areas ranging from advertising to retail to media production. Specifically, with the advent of AI, opponents of Big Tech are concerned of the growing threats of new advanced generative AI systems undermining jobs, exploiting copyrighted material for training data, and producing misinformation and harmful content.\nFriends in high places\nBig Tech has been looking to curry favor with French officials. Last week, at the \"Choose France\" foreign investment summit, Microsoft and Amazon signed commitments to invest a combined 5.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of funding for cloud and AI infrastructure and jobs in France. This week, French President Emmanuel Macron met with Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist of Meta, and Google's Manyika, among other tech leaders, at the Elysee Palace to discuss ways of making Paris a global AI hub.\nwatch now\nIn a statement issued by the Elysee, and translated into English via Google Translate, Macron welcomed leaders from various tech firms to France and thanked them for their \"commitment to France to be there at Viva Tech.\" Macron said that the \"pride is mine to have you here as talents\" in the global AI sphere. Matt Calkins, CEO of U.S. enterprise software firm Appian, told CNBC that large tech firms \"have a disproportionate influence on the development and deployment of AI technologies.\" \"I am concerned that there is potential for monopolies to emerge around Big Tech and AI,\" he said. \"They can train their models on privately-owned data \u2014 as long as they anonymize it. This isn't enough.\" \"We need more privacy than this if we use individual and business data,\" Calkins added.\n\ntitle3:\nCanva launches a proper enterprise product \u2014 and they mean it this time\ndescription3:\nBack in 2019, Canva, the wildly successful design tool, introduced what the company was calling an enterprise product, but in reality it was more geared toward teams than fulfilling true enterprise requirements. On Thursday, the company changed that, announcing a new enterprise version that is truly geared toward the needs of larger organizations.\nThat includes the types of features that you would expect in this kind of product, including single sign-on, enhanced security offerings and tools for managing larger groups of users that IT would expect. It also offers centralized brand management and dedicated support.\nCam Adams, co-founder and CPO at the company, says in 2019, they were looking at moving from supporting mostly individual users to supporting small teams from between five and 100 users. Over the intervening years, they began seeing much larger organizations using Canva, and recognized that they needed a product more geared toward the requirements of these larger companies.\n\u201cWe now have cohorts with up to 5,000 people using Canva inside an enterprise, and because of that, there\u2019s a new type of Canva enterprise product that we\u2019ve needed to ship to meet the needs of those larger groups. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve actually done with Canva Enterprise,\u201d Adams told TechCrunch.\nThis version is trying to address three specific problems Canva saw as it moved into larger organizations.\nFor starters, design isn\u2019t confined to one group anymore. It spans multiple departments and industries. Secondly, there are myriad AI tools and Adams says he\u2019s seeing CIOs becoming increasingly wary of \u201cAI tool creep.\u201d And finally, there is a workflow component. As more departments are involved in the design process, and as AI becomes more prominent, it requires a tool that can handle not just back-end user management, but also moving work across these different constituencies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re no longer just thinking about empowering every person. We\u2019re really thinking about the second decade of Canva being about empowering every organization. And when we think of enterprises, we\u2019re really looking at bringing all that fragmentation together into the one platform,\u201d he said.\nThe prior version of the product is becoming a proper teams product and will cost $100 per seat per year with a three-person minimum. The enterprise pricing starts at $300 per seat per year, but with negotiated volume-based discounts available.\nThe Australian company was founded in 2012 and has raised more than $560 million, most recently at an astonishing $26 billion valuation, per the company. It boasts over 180 million monthly users worldwide.\n\ntitle4:\nTicketmaster antitrust lawsuit could give new hope to ticketing startups\ndescription4:\nThe United States Department of Justice and 30 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment, the parent company of Ticketmaster, for alleged monopolistic practices.\nLive Nation and Ticketmaster merged in 2010, creating a dominant entertainment machine that controls the majority of ticket sales and venue bookings in the country. But Taylor Swift fans\u2019 experience buying tickets for the Eras tour in late 2022 was so horrific that legislators took a closer look at the entertainment giant\u2019s control over the industry \u2014 the presale was riddled with glitches and hours-long wait times, while the public sale was canceled due to high traffic.\n\u201cLive Nation suffocates its competition using a variety of tactics, from acquisitions of smaller regional promoters and venues, to threats and retaliation to agreements with rivals,\u201d said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a press conference on Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t just a Swiftie problem \u2014 rather, the pop star\u2019s cultural ubiquity shed a brighter spotlight on the frustrations people have with Live Nation-Ticketmaster. From punk bands to podcast hosts, poor experiences with Ticketmaster have made the company loathsome to fans. In April, when the Dungeons & Dragons actual play show Dimension 20 put tickets on sale for its performance at Madison Square Garden, Ticketmaster\u2019s dynamic pricing structure made ticket prices so astronomically high that they were unattainable for most fans. Dropout, the company that produces Dimension 20, later stated that dynamic pricing \u2014 which automatically raises ticket prices based on demand \u2014 was not explained to them before ticket sales.\nIf a breakup were to occur, it could also pave the way for other ticketing startups to gain traction in an industry where they now face an uphill battle when going against Ticketmaster. That\u2019s led to businesses in this space trying to disrupt the current system by building a new one \u2014 like on the blockchain, for example, or by focusing only on the secondary market.\nLive Nation executive vice president Dan Wall published a statement responding to the allegations in the Department of Justice\u2019s lawsuit.\n\u201cThe complaint\u2014and even more so the press conference announcing it\u2014attempt to portray Live Nation and Ticketmaster as the cause of fan frustration with the live entertainment industry,\u201d the statement says. \u201cIt blames concert promoters and ticketing companies\u2014neither of which control ticket prices\u2014for high ticket prices. It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from increasing production costs to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public\u2019s willingness to pay far more than primary tickets cost.\u201d\nWall goes on to compare Ticketmaster\u2019s 5% take rate with that of companies like Twitch (50%), StubHub (37%), Uber (25%) and several more. But with the exception of StubHub \u2014 a resale platform \u2014 the comparisons are not quite one-to-one. Ticketmaster also charges various kinds of service fees, which exceed 5%. The fact remains that it\u2019s difficult for younger companies to disrupt Live Nation\u2019s hold on the industry since the vast majority of American venues are in business with them.\nGarland claims that the public frustration with Live Nation\u2019s alleged monopolistic behavior is more acute in America than in other countries.\n\u201cIn other countries, where venues are not bound by Ticketmaster\u2019s exclusive ticketing contracts, venues often use multiple ticketing companies for the same event, and fans see lower fees and more innovative ticketing products as a result,\u201d Garland said.\"\n\nResponse:",
