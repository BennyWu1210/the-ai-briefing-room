The vehicle launched from its pad in Texas at 8:50AM ET, before successfully performing a hot-stage separation from its booster rocket. The Super Heavy booster then performed a landing burn as planned before it came down in the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Starship vehicle continued along its planned flight path before reentry. Live camera views showed a damaged flap burning and starting to come apart. However, the vehicle stayed in one piece long enough for the engines to relight and perform a \u201csoft landing.\u201d In a tweet, Elon Musk said, \u201cDespite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\u201d\nThe two-stage 394-foot system, comprised of both the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft, is the most powerful launch vehicle ever developed. Known collectively as Starship, its immense payload capacity should enable it to transport satellites, large quantities of cargo, and up to 100 people for future space missions. SpaceX designed both the craft and booster components to be fully reusable in a bid to dramatically lower the costs typically associated with space travel.\nHere is the flight plan outlining the objectives for Starship\u2019s fourth test. Image: SpaceX\nToday\u2019s launch follows Starship\u2019s three previous test flights. The last attempt in March successfully launched before it was \u201clost\u201d shortly before its anticipated splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The craft performed several of its objective maneuvers before breaking apart during reentry, including its first full-duration ascent burn, hot-staging separation from its Super Heavy booster, and opening its payload door in space.\n\ntitle1:\nU.S. regulators to open antitrust probes into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI\ndescription1:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman (L) speaks with Microsoft Chief Technology Officer and Executive VP of Artificial Intelligence Kevin Scott during the Microsoft Build conference at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on May 21, 2024.\nThe Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are set to open antitrust investigations into Microsoft , OpenAI and Nvidia , examining the powerful companies' influence on the artificial intelligence industry, a source familiar confirmed to CNBC.\nThe FTC will take the lead on looking into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ will focus on Nvidia, and the investigations will focus on the companies' conduct, rather than mergers and acquisitions, according to the source.\nThe New York Times first reported on the investigation.\nAs startups like OpenAI and Anthropic \u2014 the companies behind the ChatGPT and Claude chatbots, respectively \u2014 gain steam in the generative AI market, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have been part of an AI arms race of sorts, racing to integrate the technology to ensure they don't fall behind in a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\nMicrosoft, for instance, first invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. The size of its investment has since swelled to about $13 billion. Microsoft heavily uses OpenAI's model for its Copilot chatbot and offers open-source models on its Azure cloud.\nThe hefty investments are necessary because AI models are notoriously expensive to build and train, requiring thousands of specialized chips that, to date, have largely come from Nvidia. Meta , which is developing its own model called Llama, has said it's spending billions on Nvidia's graphics processing units, one of the many companies that's helped the chipmaker bolster year-over-year revenue by more than 250%.\nNews of the coming antitrust investigation comes days after a group of current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter Tuesday, describing concerns about the AI industry's rapid advancement despite a lack of oversight and an absence of whistleblower protections for those who wish to speak up.\n\"AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" the employees wrote, adding that the companies \"currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\"\nThe news also follows the FTC's January decision to conduct an extensive study on AI industry heavyweights, including Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft, Anthropic and OpenAI.\nFTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry in January during the agency's tech summit on AI, describing it as a \"market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.\"\nBy invoking its authority to conduct a so-called 6(b) study \u2014 named for Section 6(b) of the FTC Act \u2014 the regulator can look into the AI companies separately from its law enforcement arm and make civil investigative demands. For example, the agency can order companies to file specific reports and answer questions in writing about their businesses.\n\"At the FTC, the rapid development and deployment of AI is informing our work across the agency,\" Khan said at the time. \"There's no AI exemption from the laws on the books, and we're looking closely at the ways companies may be using their power to thwart competition or trick the public.\"\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. Microsoft and Nvidia declined to comment.\n\ntitle2:\nHSBC believes that $22 billion Byju\u2019s is now worth zero\ndescription2:\nIn a research note, HSBC estimates that the Indian edtech giant Byju\u2019s, once valued at $22 billion, is now worth nothing. The write-down in its estimation makes Byju\u2019s one of the most spectacular startup slides in recent memory.\nIt follows a very rough year for the Bengaluru-based startup, which was India\u2019s most valuable not long ago. Byju\u2019s struggled to meet its financial reporting deadlines last year, ultimately falling short of its target by over 50% as it faced various governance issues.\nThose issues \u2014 coupled with abrupt resignations from its auditor and board members \u2014 contributed to derailing a $1 billion fundraise deliberation by Byju\u2019s.\nProsus, one of Byju\u2019s largest investors, publicly slammed the startup, alleging it \u201cregularly disregarded advice\u201d from the backer. Amid the funding crunch, Byju\u2019s then raised $200 million at a post-money valuation of about $250 million this year \u2013 a funding that is being legally disputed by some of the largest Byju\u2019s investors, including Prosus.\nIt stands to reason then, that in the research note HSBC also estimated the value of Prosus\u2019 10% stake in the Indian startup to be zero because of the ongoing legal cases and funding crunch.\nThe bank also estimated that a number of other startups are not nearly as valuable as they once were.\nIt estimates that the online pharmacy Pharmeasy should be valued at $2.8 billion (down from a high of $5.6 billion in 2021), social commerce Meesho $2.5 billion (down from $4.9 billion), Indian agritech startup DeHaat $400 million (down from $800 million), and an otherwise unicorn logistics startup ElasticRun $800 million.\nThe bank estimates that Stack Overflow, a firm Prosus acquired last year for $1.8 billion, should be valued at $900 million and GoodHabitz to $100 million (down from $200 million).\n\u201cWe apply a 50% discount to the latest funding round/acquisition price for assets where the last round is older than six months to account for the recent correction in similar edtech/SaaS companies\u2019 public sector multiples,\u201d HSBC added.\nByju\u2019s didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours.\n\ntitle3:\nRobinhood acquires global crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200M\ndescription3:\nStock-trading app Robinhood is diving deeper into the cryptocurrency realm with the acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp.\nRobinhood on Thursday said it expects the final transaction value to be around $200 million and the deal to close in the first half of 2025.\nRobinhood is known for its stock-trading services, allowing ordinary consumers to invest in some of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded companies, but it has been moving further into crypto territory over the years. The company has added support for many of the most popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, though it restricted some of the crypto it supports last year due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.\nMore crypto and global expansion\nToday\u2019s deal signals California-based Robinhood\u2019s continued push not only into crypto, but also its international expansion efforts. The company launched its core stock-trading product in the U.K. last November and started offering crypto trading in the European Union (EU) shortly afterward.\nFounded in Europe in 2011, Bitstamp is among the world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing companies and individuals to trade all manner of cryptocurrency. It was acquired by a Belgian investment company called NXMH in 2018 and last year, Ripple bought a stake, too.\nRobinhood went public in mid-2021, and as with many firms that fared well during the pandemic, the company saw its initial good fortunes crumble as the world (and investor sentiment) returned to normality. The company\u2019s IPO valuation of $32 billion surged to more than $40 billion at one point, before steadily declining well below the $10 billion mark for much of the past two years.\nHowever, the trading app has seen its valuation more than double in the past year to $19 billion, buoyed by record earnings. In its Q1 2024 report in May, Robinhood said its monthly active users had increased 16% year-on-year to 13.7 million, while its revenues rose 40% to $618 million. Notably, the company said its transaction-based revenue had risen by 59% to $329 million, primarily driven by a 232% increase in cryptocurrency income, which came to $126 million.\nWith Bitstamp under its wing, Robinhood says it will be better positioned to target retail and institutional crypto investors across Europe, Asia and the U.S. Bitstamp currently holds more than 50 licenses and registrations to operate in these markets.\n\u201cThe acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business,\u201d Robinhood\u2019s crypto general manager, Johann Kerbrat, said in a statement. \u201cThe Bitstamp team has established one of the strongest reputations across retail and institutional crypto investors. Through this strategic combination, we are better positioned to expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers to Robinhood.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nSalesforce to open new AI center in London in UK investment drive\ndescription4:\nIn this article CRM Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nA Salesforce corporate logo hangs over the front door of the Salesforce Tower on January 22, 2024, in New York City. Gary Hershorn | Getty Images\nLONDON \u2014 Enterprise tech giant Salesforce is opening an artificial intelligence center in London, making a bullish bet on the U.K. as a global technology hub. The U.S. software giant said in a statement Thursday that it is opening a more-than-40,000-square-foot facility in London's Blue Fin Building, which can host over 300 people. It will be used to encourage industry collaboration among tech firms, AI experts, Salesforce partners and customers, the company said, as well as facilitate AI training and upskilling programs. Salesforce said it expects the AI center to play a role in creating 500,000 AI-related jobs in the U.K. The facility will officially open June 18 with a free event to train more than 100 developers.\nSalesforce said the center, which is planned to be the first of many globally, would support its U.K. and Ireland business. It will be led by the firm's U.K. and Ireland CEO, Zahra Bahrololoumi. The news was announced at the Salesforce World Tour event at the London Excel venue on Thursday, which is expected to see more than 17,500 delegates and customers gather from companies including Aston Martin, McLaren, Just Eat Takeway and John Lewis. \"By locating Salesforce's first, flagship AI center in London, we are sending a clear message to customers and partners on AI: we are deeply committed to working closely together so that you can reap the rewards of this transformative technology, while ensuring it is a force for good,\" Salesforce's Bahrololoumi said in a statement.\n$4 billion investment in UK\nThe AI center forms part of a $4 billion investment in the U.K., which Salesforce committed to make over five years in 2023.\nIn addition to announcing the opening of its AI center, Salesforce also revealed that it had invested more than $200 million into U.K. startups via its venture capital arm, Salesforce Ventures. These include the procurement platform AutoGen AI and Eleven Labs, an AI-powered text-to-speech and voice generator. Patrick Stokes, executive vice president of product and industries marketing, said the U.K. was a \"really interesting place to a really interesting place to do it, because some of the challenges here with AI and data are, in some cases a little bit more difficult to solve than they are in the US, there's a little bit more regulation here. And consumer protection. And that somewhat counter intuitively, that's a good thing for us as, as enterprise developers, because if we can solve those problems here, we've kind of solved them for everywhere. So typically, you want to kind of lean into the more challenging environments, from a from a product development standpoint, and learn as much as you can, it, as you know, is more challenging environments. We expect to see more of that type of regulation and consumer privacy protection. There are parts of the United States where we were where we see it emerging, we'd like to see more so. So I think leaning into the UK is a smart decision for us. And it ties in very nicely to the commitment that we made, probably right here in this room last year. For a billion investment in the UK. The news comes amid concerns over whether Salesforce's investments into AI are paying off. The company last week reported weaker-than-expected fiscal first-quarter revenue and issued guidance that fell short of investor expectations. Salesforce reported revenue of $9.13 billion for the period, up 11% from a year ago but below analyst expectations of $9.17 billion. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $2.34 to $2.36 per share for the current quarter, lower than the $2.40 per share expected by analysts.\"\n\nResponse:",

    "Image Prompt": "a cohesive podcast cover image featuring the vast expanse of space with earth in the background, partially shrouded in night, showcasing the terminator line between day and night. in the foreground, spacex's starship spacecraft splashes down into a serene ocean, with the splash subtly creating ripple effects that transition into digital waves. these waves morph into dynamic data streams which lead to a larger-than-life visage of an ai entity, symbolizing \"ai giants under scrutiny.\" the ai's form is constructed from intricate circuits and codes, blending seamlessly into the digital waves. to the right, the data streams culminate into the robinhood logo embedded within a futuristic cityscape that's connected through glowing blockchain pathways representing its \"crypto expansion.\" the elements fluidly integrate to form a visually striking, unified cover image demonstrating the convergence of space exploration, artificial intelligence, and financial technology innovation"
