Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) and Lori Trahan (D-Mass.). They noted the ads were \"approved and monetized by Meta\" and that they were not hidden on the dark web or private social media pages. Media outlets and researchers could easily find the ads, which contained \"contained blatant references to illegal drugs,\" while Meta's internal processes apparently missed them, according to the letter.\n\"Time and time again we have heard from Meta that users come to your platforms because they like the personalization and experiences you provide, and you use sensitive personal information to direct such personalization through content and advertisements,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"We in Congress, on multiple occasions, have worked to establish data privacy and security protections for Americans but have, in each instance, been met with friction and opposition from Meta with claims that we would drastically disrupt this personalization you are providing.\"\nThey sent Zuckerberg a list of 15 questions intended to uncover more details about how the Facebook parent is addressing the problem, and asked him to respond by Sept. 6.\nMeta confirmed receipt of the letter and said it plans to respond. The company shared with CNBC the statement below that it gave to the Journal when it published the initial story:\n\ntitle1:\nCisco stock has best day since 2020 on earnings beat, 7% job cuts\ndescription1:\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins participates in a Bloomberg Television interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2023.\nCisco shares jumped about 7% on Thursday for their best day since November 2020, after the computer networking company said it's cutting 7% of its workforce and reported quarterly results that beat analyst estimates.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said in a note to investors that Cisco's results were better than feared.\n\"Cisco's FQ4 beat, and better than expected order numbers were a relief, and supported Cisco falling back into more predictable patterns after nearly 4 years of disruption,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the stock.\nCisco reported $13.64 billion in revenue for the quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $13.54 billion. Revenue fell 10% from the year-ago quarter, marking the third straight quarter of sales declines. Net income plummeted 45% from a year earlier, but profit still exceeded expectations.\nAnalysts at Bank of America noted that networking sales were down 28.1% year-over-year but said that was mostly due to tough comparisons, and that the focal point of the quarter was on order recovery.\n\"Data center switching orders were up double-digits YoY, while orders for campus switching and routing were up high-single digits,\" the analysts, who have a buy rating on Cisco, wrote in a report. They added that orders tied to artificial intelligence crossed $1 billion and revenue will start to ramp in the first half of 2025.\nThe company's core networking business, which includes routers and switches, has struggled since large companies started moving to the cloud. Cisco's sales have been partially offset by recurring revenue from its software and securities businesses.\nCisco said in a filing that it's implementing a restructuring plan with layoffs that will result in $1 billion in pretax charges to its financial results and will \"allow it to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in its business.\"\nCEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday that the company will try to move some employees into other jobs at the firm.\n\"The big question that we talked about going into this is, is everybody going to think that this is AI-driven?\" Robbins said. He added that there's an aspect of AI that could be used to make general and administrative tasks more efficient using automation systems.\nIt's the second major round of layoffs this year for Cisco. The company said in February that it was eliminating 5% of its workforce, or over 4,000 jobs. Cisco had 84,900 employees at the end of fiscal 2023, before the initial cuts.\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Ari Levy contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins on Q4 results\n\ntitle2:\nCalifornia weakens bill to prevent AI disasters before final vote, taking advice from Anthropic\ndescription2:\nCalifornia\u2019s bill to prevent AI disasters, SB 1047, has faced significant opposition from many parties in Silicon Valley. Today, California lawmakers bent slightly to that pressure, adding in several amendments suggested by AI firm Anthropic and other opponents.\nOn Thursday the bill passed through California\u2019s Appropriations Committee, a major step toward becoming law, with several key changes, Senator Wiener\u2019s office told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe accepted a number of very reasonable amendments proposed, and I believe we\u2019ve addressed the core concerns expressed by Anthropic and many others in the industry,\u201d said Senator Wiener in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThese amendments build on significant changes to SB 1047 I made previously to accommodate the unique needs of the open source community, which is an important source of innovation.\u201d\nSB 1047 still aims to prevent large AI systems from killing lots of people, or causing cybersecurity events that cost over $500 million, by holding developers liable. However, the bill now grants California\u2019s government less power to hold AI labs to account.\nWhat does SB 1047 do now?\nMost notably, the bill no longer allows California\u2019s attorney general to sue AI companies for negligent safety practices before a catastrophic event has occurred. This was a suggestion from Anthropic.\nInstead, California\u2019s attorney general can seek injunctive relief, requesting a company to cease a certain operation it finds dangerous, and can still sue an AI developer if its model does cause a catastrophic event.\nFurther, SB 1047 no longer creates the Frontier Model Division (FMD), a new government agency formerly included in the bill. However, the bill still creates the Board of Frontier Models \u2014 the core of the FMD \u2014 and places them inside the existing Government Operations Agency. In fact, the board is bigger now, with nine people instead of five. The Board of Frontier Models will still set compute thresholds for covered models, issue safety guidance and issue regulations for auditors.\nSenator Wiener also amended SB 1047 so that AI labs no longer need to submit certifications of safety test results \u201cunder penalty of perjury.\u201d Now, these AI labs are simply required to submit public \u201cstatements\u201d outlining their safety practices, but the bill no longer imposes any criminal liability.\nSB 1047 also now includes more lenient language around how developers ensure AI models are safe. Now, the bill requires developers to provide \u201creasonable care\u201d AI models do not pose a significant risk of causing catastrophe, instead of the \u201creasonable assurance\u201d the bill required before.\nFurther, lawmakers added a protection for open source fine-tuned models. If someone spends less than $10 million fine-tuning a covered model, they are explicitly not considered a developer by SB 1047. The responsibility will still be on the original, larger developer of the model.\nWhy all the changes now?\nWhile the bill has faced significant opposition from U.S. congressmen, renowned AI researchers, Big Tech and venture capitalists, the bill has flown through California\u2019s legislature with relative ease. These amendments are likely to appease SB 1047 opponents and present Governor Newsom with a less controversial bill he can sign into law without losing support from the AI industry.\nWhile Newsom has not publicly commented on SB 1047, he\u2019s previously indicated his commitment to California\u2019s AI innovation.\nAnthropic tells TechCrunch it\u2019s reviewing SB 1047\u2019s changes before it takes a position. Not all of Anthropic\u2019s suggested amendments were adopted by Senator Wiener.\n\u201cThe goal of SB 1047 is\u2014and has always been\u2014to advance AI safety, while still allowing for innovation across the ecosystem,\u201d said Nathan Calvin, senior policy counsel for the Center for AI Safety Action Fund. \u201cThe new amendments will support that goal.\u201d\nThat said, these changes are unlikely to appease staunch critics of SB 1047. While the bill is notably weaker than before these amendments, SB 1047 still holds developers liable for the dangers of their AI models. That core fact about SB 1047 is not universally supported, and these amendments do little to address it.\n\u201cThe edits are window dressing,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz general partner Martin Casado in a tweet. \u201cThey don\u2019t address the real issues or criticisms of the bill.\u201d\nIn fact, moments after SB 1047 passed on Thursday, eight United States Congress members representing California wrote a letter asking Governor Newsom to veto SB 1047. They write the bill \u201cwould not be good for our state, for the start-up community, for scientific development, or even for protection against possible harm associated with AI development.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?\nSB 1047 is now headed to California\u2019s Assembly floor for a final vote. If it passes there, it will need to be referred back to California\u2019s Senate for a vote due to these latest amendments. If it passes both, it will head to Governor Newsom\u2019s desk, where it could be vetoed or signed into law.\n\ntitle3:\nApple, Google wallets will soon support California driver's licenses\ndescription3:\nCalifornia residents will soon be able to store their driver\u2019s license or state ID in their Apple Wallet or Google Wallet apps, as the state\u2019s government announced Thursday that support for digital IDs is launching in the coming weeks.\nCalifornians with an ID in the Apple Wallet or Google Wallet app will be able to use their mobile devices to present their ID in person at select TSA security checkpoints and businesses. They can also use the app to verify their age or identity in select apps.\nOther states that already support digital driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs include Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland and Ohio.\nTo load your ID into the Apple Wallet app, you need to click on the \u201c+\u201d button at the top of the screen in the app, then choose \u201cDriver\u2019s License or State ID.\u201d From there, you need to follow the on-screen instructions to start the setup and verification process. You will prompted to take a selfie and then scan the front and back on your driver\u2019s license or state ID card.\nTo do so in the Google Wallet app, you need to tap the \u201cAdd to Wallet\u201d option in the app and then select the \u201cID card.\u201d Then, you need to select your state and follow the verification steps with your physical ID.\n\u201cWe\u2019re partnering with two iconic California companies \u2013 Apple and Google \u2013 to provide convenient, private and secure driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards directly on people\u2019s phones,\u201d said California Governor Gavin Newsom in a statement. \u201cThis is a big step in our efforts to better serve all Californians, meeting people where they\u2019re at and with technology people use every day,\u201d he added.\nThe governor\u2019s website noted that more than 500,000 Californians have already added a mobile driver\u2019s license (mDL) to their phone using the California DMV Wallet app. The mDL pilot program has been limited to 1.5 million participants.\nAccording to the Secure Technology Alliance, more than 20 states are currently exploring the idea of adopting mobile digital licenses.\nThese states include Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle\u2019s upgraded AI image generator is now available\ndescription4:\nGoogle has released the latest version of Imagen 3, its AI text-to-image generator, to users in the US, as spotted by VentureBeat. The tool, which you can access on Google\u2019s AI Test Kitchen, is supposed to generate images with \u201cbetter detail, richer lighting, and fewer distracting artifacts\u201d compared to Google\u2019s previous models.\nGoogle first announced its updated Imagen 3 tool during I/O in May, but it only appears to have made the tool generally available through its Vertex AI platform within the past several days. Some Reddit users started experimenting with Imagen 3 last week, and Google published a research paper on the tool on Tuesday.\nLike other AI image generators, Imagen 3 can create detailed images based on your prompt. You can also edit the image by highlighting a certain part and describing what you want to change.\nIt was relatively easy to get Imagen to generate images resembling Sonic. Image: Emma Roth / Imagen 3\nThere seem to be some guardrails in place, as the tool will decline to generate images of public figures, like Taylor Swift, and also won\u2019t produce images of weapons. And while it will stop short of generating named copyrighted characters, you can get around this pretty easily by describing the character you want to create.\nI got the tool to generate images that look very much like Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario, while my colleague was able to create characters resembling Mickey Mouse. I also found that it will generate logos belonging to companies like Apple, Macy\u2019s, Hershey\u2019s, and even Google, which you can see in the image at the top of this article.\nDespite these somewhat flexible guardrails, Imagen 3 still stands in stark contrast to Grok, the AI image generator that lives on Elon Musk\u2019s X platform. Grok has been used to generate all sorts of wild content, including images with drugs, violence, and public figures doing questionable things.\"\n\nResponse:",
