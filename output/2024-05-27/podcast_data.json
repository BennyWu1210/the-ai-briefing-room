Last year, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that xAI was looking to raise up to $1 billion in equity investments, and a few months ago, The Financial Times reported it was seeking up to.... $6 billion. Musk denied that report at the time.\nThe hardware capable of powering AI development is pretty pricey, with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell B200 AI graphics cards costing anywhere from $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. Last week, a report from The Information said that xAI would need 100,000 of Nvidia\u2019s current H100 chips for a supercomputer to power an upgraded version of its Grok AI chatbot. Musk reportedly told investors the plan is to launch the new data center by the fall of 2025.\nContinuing on in the AI race for chips, talent, and technology won\u2019t be cheap \u2014 big tech firms have dumped billions into AI startups like Anthropic in addition to the resources Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are pouring into AI projects of their own.\nMicrosoft has also struck a multi-billion partnership with OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman is reportedly pursuing trillions more dollars to revamp the global chip industry. Musk, a founding member of OpenAI, is suing that company while claiming it has abandoned its mission to benefit humanity.\n\ntitle1:\nEU's ChatGPT taskforce offers first look at detangling the AI chatbot's privacy compliance\ndescription1:\nA data protection taskforce that\u2019s spent over a year considering how the European Union\u2019s data protection rulebook applies to OpenAI\u2019s viral chatbot, ChatGPT, reported preliminary conclusions Friday. The top-line takeaway is that the working group of privacy enforcers remains undecided on crux legal issues, such as the lawfulness and fairness of OpenAI\u2019s processing.\nThe issue is important as penalties for confirmed violations of the bloc\u2019s privacy regime can reach up to 4% of global annual turnover. Watchdogs can also order non-compliant processing to stop. So \u2014 in theory \u2014 OpenAI is facing considerable regulatory risk in the region at a time when dedicated laws for AI are thin on the ground (and, even in the EU\u2019s case, years away from being fully operational).\nBut without clarity from EU data protection enforcers on how current data protection laws apply to ChatGPT, it\u2019s a safe bet that OpenAI will feel empowered to continue business as usual \u2014 despite the existence of a growing number of complaints its technology violates various aspects of the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nFor example, this investigation from Poland\u2019s data protection authority (DPA) was opened following a complaint about the chatbot making up information about an individual and refusing to correct the errors. A similar complaint was recently lodged in Austria.\nLots of GDPR complaints, a lot less enforcement\nOn paper, the GDPR applies whenever personal data is collected and processed \u2014 something large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s GPT, the AI model behind ChatGPT, are demonstrably doing at vast scale when they scrape data off the public internet to train their models, including by syphoning people\u2019s posts off social media platforms.\nThe EU regulation also empowers DPAs to order any non-compliant processing to stop. This could be a very powerful lever for shaping how the AI giant behind ChatGPT can operate in the region if GDPR enforcers choose to pull it.\nIndeed, we saw a glimpse of this last year when Italy\u2019s privacy watchdog hit OpenAI with a temporary ban on processing the data of local users of ChatGPT. The action, taken using emergency powers contained in the GDPR, led to the AI giant briefly shutting down the service in the country.\nChatGPT only resumed in Italy after OpenAI made changes to the information and controls it provides to users in response to a list of demands by the DPA. But the Italian investigation into the chatbot, including crux issues like the legal basis OpenAI claims for processing people\u2019s data to train its AI models in the first place, continues. So the tool remains under a legal cloud in the EU.\nUnder the GDPR, any entity that wants to process data about people must have a legal basis for the operation. The regulation sets out six possible bases \u2014 though most are not available in OpenAI\u2019s context. And the Italian DPA already instructed the AI giant it cannot rely on claiming a contractual necessity to process people\u2019s data to train its AIs \u2014 leaving it with just two possible legal bases: either consent (i.e. asking users for permission to use their data); or a wide-ranging basis called legitimate interests (LI), which demands a balancing test and requires the controller to allow users to object to the processing.\nSince Italy\u2019s intervention, OpenAI appears to have switched to claiming it has a LI for processing personal data used for model training. However, in January, the DPA\u2019s draft decision on its investigation found OpenAI had violated the GDPR. Although no details of the draft findings were published so we have yet to see the authority\u2019s full assessment on the legal basis point. A final decision on the complaint remains pending.\nA precision \u2018fix\u2019 for ChatGPT\u2019s lawfulness?\nThe taskforce\u2019s report discusses this knotty lawfulness issue, pointing out ChatGPT needs a valid legal basis for all stages of personal data processing \u2014 including collection of training data; pre-processing of the data (such as filtering); training itself; prompts and ChatGPT outputs; and any training on ChatGPT prompts.\nThe first three of the listed stages carry what the taskforce couches as \u201cpeculiar risks\u201d for people\u2019s fundamental rights \u2014 with the report highlighting how the scale and automation of web scraping can lead to large volumes of personal data being ingested, covering many aspects of people\u2019s lives. It also notes scraped data may include the most sensitive types of personal data (which the GDPR refers to as \u201cspecial category data\u201d), such as health info, sexuality, political views etc, which requires an even higher legal bar for processing than general personal data.\nOn special category data, the taskforce also asserts that just because it\u2019s public does not mean it can be considered to have been made \u201cmanifestly\u201d public \u2014 which would trigger an exemption from the GDPR requirement for explicit consent to process this type of data. (\u201cIn order to rely on the exception laid down in Article 9(2)(e) GDPR, it is important to ascertain whether the data subject had intended, explicitly and by a clear affirmative action, to make the personal data in question accessible to the general public,\u201d it writes on this.)\nTo rely on LI as its legal basis in general, OpenAI needs to demonstrate it needs to process the data; the processing should also be limited to what is necessary for this need; and it must undertake a balancing test, weighing its legitimate interests in the processing against the rights and freedoms of the data subjects (i.e. people the data is about).\nHere, the taskforce has another suggestion, writing that \u201cadequate safeguards\u201d \u2014 such as \u201ctechnical measures\u201d, defining \u201cprecise collection criteria\u201d and/or blocking out certain data categories or sources (like social media profiles), to allow for less data to be collected in the first place to reduce impacts on individuals \u2014 could \u201cchange the balancing test in favor of the controller\u201d, as it puts it.\nThis approach could force AI companies to take more care about how and what data they collect to limit privacy risks.\n\u201cFurthermore, measures should be in place to delete or anonymise personal data that has been collected via web scraping before the training stage,\u201d the taskforce also suggests.\nOpenAI is also seeking to rely on LI for processing ChatGPT users\u2019 prompt data for model training. On this, the report emphasizes the need for users to be \u201cclearly and demonstrably informed\u201d such content may be used for training purposes \u2014 noting this is one of the factors that would be considered in the balancing test for LI.\nIt will be up to the individual DPAs assessing complaints to decide if the AI giant has fulfilled the requirements to actually be able to rely on LI. If it can\u2019t, ChatGPT\u2019s maker would be left with only one legal option in the EU: asking citizens for consent. And given how many people\u2019s data is likely contained in training data-sets it\u2019s unclear how workable that would be. (Deals the AI giant is fast cutting with news publishers to license their journalism, meanwhile, wouldn\u2019t translate into a template for licensing European\u2019s personal data as the law doesn\u2019t allow people to sell their consent; consent must be freely given.)\nFairness & transparency aren\u2019t optional\nElsewhere, on the GDPR\u2019s fairness principle, the taskforce\u2019s report stresses that privacy risk cannot be transferred to the user, such as by embedding a clause in T&Cs that \u201cdata subjects are responsible for their chat inputs\u201d.\n\u201cOpenAI remains responsible for complying with the GDPR and should not argue that the input of certain personal data was prohibited in first place,\u201d it adds.\nOn transparency obligations, the taskforce appears to accept OpenAI could make use of an exemption (GDPR Article 14(5)(b)) to notify individuals about data collected about them, given the scale of the web scraping involved in acquiring data-sets to train LLMs. But its report reiterates the \u201cparticular importance\u201d of informing users their inputs may be used for training purposes.\nThe report also touches on the issue of ChatGPT \u2018hallucinating\u2019 (making information up), warning that the GDPR \u201cprinciple of data accuracy must be complied with\u201d \u2014 and emphasizing the need for OpenAI to therefore provide \u201cproper information\u201d on the \u201cprobabilistic output\u201d of the chatbot and its \u201climited level of reliability\u201d.\nThe taskforce also suggests OpenAI provides users with an \u201cexplicit reference\u201d that generated text \u201cmay be biased or made up\u201d.\nOn data subject rights, such as the right to rectification of personal data \u2014 which has been the focus of a number of GDPR complaints about ChatGPT \u2014 the report describes it as \u201cimperative\u201d people are able to easily exercise their rights. It also observes limitations in OpenAI\u2019s current approach, including the fact it does not let users have incorrect personal information generated about them corrected, but only offers to block the generation.\nHowever the taskforce does not offer clear guidance on how OpenAI can improve the \u201cmodalities\u201d it offers users to exercise their data rights \u2014 it just makes a generic recommendation the company applies \u201cappropriate measures designed to implement data protection principles in an effective manner\u201d and \u201cnecessary safeguards\u201d to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect the rights of data subjects\u201d. Which sounds a lot like \u2018we don\u2019t know how to fix this either\u2019.\nChatGPT GDPR enforcement on ice?\nThe ChatGPT taskforce was set up, back in April 2023, on the heels of Italy\u2019s headline-grabbing intervention on OpenAI, with the aim of streamlining enforcement of the bloc\u2019s privacy rules on the nascent technology. The taskforce operates within a regulatory body called the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which steers application of EU law in this area. Although it\u2019s important to note DPAs remain independent and are competent to enforce the law on their own patch where GDPR enforcement is decentralized.\nDespite the indelible independence of DPAs to enforce locally, there is clearly some nervousness/risk aversion among watchdogs about how to respond to a nascent tech like ChatGPT.\nEarlier this year, when the Italian DPA announced its draft decision, it made a point of noting its proceeding would \u201ctake into account\u201d the work of the EDPB taskforce. And there other signs watchdogs may be more inclined to wait for the working group to weigh in with a final report \u2014 maybe in another year\u2019s time \u2014 before wading in with their own enforcements. So the taskforce\u2019s mere existence may already be influencing GDPR enforcements on OpenAI\u2019s chatbot by delaying decisions and putting investigations of complaints into the slow lane.\nFor example, in a recent interview in local media, Poland\u2019s data protection authority suggested its investigation into OpenAI would need to wait for the taskforce to complete its work.\nThe watchdog did not respond when we asked whether it\u2019s delaying enforcement because of the ChatGPT taskforce\u2019s parallel workstream. While a spokesperson for the EDPB told us the taskforce\u2019s work \u201cdoes not prejudge the analysis that will be made by each DPA in their respective, ongoing investigations\u201d. But they added: \u201cWhile DPAs are competent to enforce, the EDPB has an important role to play in promoting cooperation between DPAs on enforcement.\u201d\nAs it stands, there looks to be a considerable spectrum of views among DPAs on how urgently they should act on concerns about ChatGPT. So, while Italy\u2019s watchdog made headlines for its swift interventions last year, Ireland\u2019s (now former) data protection commissioner, Helen Dixon, told a Bloomberg conference in 2023 that DPAs shouldn\u2019t rush to ban ChatGPT \u2014 arguing they needed to take time to figure out \u201chow to regulate it properly\u201d.\nIt is likely no accident that OpenAI moved to set up an EU operation in Ireland last fall. The move was quietly followed, in December, by a change to its T&Cs \u2014 naming its new Irish entity, OpenAI Ireland Limited, as the regional provider of services such as ChatGPT \u2014 setting up a structure whereby the AI giant was able to apply for Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) to become its lead supervisor for GDPR oversight.\nThis regulatory-risk-focused legal restructuring appears to have paid off for OpenAI as the EDPB ChatGPT taskforce\u2019s report suggests the company was granted main establishment status as of February 15 this year \u2014 allowing it to take advantage of a mechanism in the GDPR called the One-Stop Shop (OSS), which means any cross border complaints arising since then will get funnelled via a lead DPA in the country of main establishment (i.e., in OpenAI\u2019s case, Ireland).\nWhile all this may sound pretty wonky it basically means the AI company can now dodge the risk of further decentralized GDPR enforcement \u2014 like we\u2019ve seen in Italy and Poland \u2014 as it will be Ireland\u2019s DPC that gets to take decisions on which complaints get investigated, how and when going forward.\nThe Irish watchdog has gained a reputation for taking a business-friendly approach to enforcing the GDPR on Big Tech. In other words, \u2018Big AI\u2019 may be next in line to benefit from Dublin\u2019s largess in interpreting the bloc\u2019s data protection rulebook.\nOpenAI was contacted for a response to the EDPB taskforce\u2019s preliminary report but at press time it had not responded.\n\ntitle2:\nWindows will soon let you grab text from your Android photos\ndescription2:\nAn upcoming version of Microsoft Phone Link lets you select and copy text from within images synced from your Android phone.

We\u2019re publishing these pieces throughout the year as the AI boom continues, highlighting key work that often goes unrecognized. Read more profiles here.\nArati Prabhakar is director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the science adviser to President Joe Biden. Previously, she served as director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \u2014 the first woman to hold the position \u2014 and director of DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\nPrabhakar has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Texas Tech University and earned her master\u2019s in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology. In 1984, she because the first woman to earn a doctorate in applied physics from Caltech.\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI?\nI came in to lead DARPA in 2012, and that was a moment where machine learning-based AI was burgeoning. We did amazing work with AI, and it was everywhere, so that was the first clue that something big was afoot. I came into this role at the White House in October 2022, and a month later, ChatGPT came out and captured everyone\u2019s imagination with generative AI. That created a moment that President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris seized upon to get AI on the right track, and that\u2019s been the work that we\u2019ve done over the last year.\nWhat attracted you to the field?\nI love big, powerful technologies. They always bring a bright side and a dark side, and that\u2019s certainly the case here. The most interesting work I get to do as a technical person is creating, wrangling and driving these technologies, because ultimately \u2014 if we get it right \u2014 that\u2019s where progress comes from.\nWhat advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field?\nIt\u2019s the same advice that I would give anyone who wants to participate in AI. There are so many ways to make a contribution, from getting steeped in the technology and building it, to using it for so many different applications, to doing the work to make sure we manage AI\u2019s risks and harms. Whatever you do, understand that this is a technology that brings bright and dark sides. Most of all, go do something big and useful, because this is the time!\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\nWhat I am really interested in is: What are the most pressing issues for us as a nation as we drive this technology forward? So much good work has been done to get AI on the right track and manage risks. We have a lot more to do, but the president\u2019s executive order and White House Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance to agencies about how to use AI responsibly are extremely important steps that put us on the right course.\nAnd now I think the job is twofold. One is to make sure that AI does unfold in a responsible way so that it is safe, effective and trustworthy. The second is to use it to go big and to solve some of our great challenges. It has that potential for everything from health, to education, to decarbonizing our economy, to predicting the weather and so much more. That\u2019s not going to happen automatically, but I think it\u2019s going to be well worth the journey.\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\nAI is already in our lives. AI is serving up the ads that we see online and deciding what\u2019s next in our feed. It\u2019s behind the price you pay for an airline ticket. It might be behind the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to your mortgage application. So the first thing is, just be aware of how much it is already in our environment. That can be good because of the creativity and the scale that\u2019s possible. But that also comes with significant risks, and we all need to be smart users in a world that\u2019s empowered \u2014 or driven, now \u2014 by AI.\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\nLike any potent technology, if your ambition is to use it to do something, you have to be responsible. That starts by recognizing that the power of these AI systems comes with enormous risks, and different kinds of risks depending on the application. We know you can use generative AI, for example, to boost creativity. But we also know it can warp our information environment. We know it can create safety and security problems.\nThere are many applications where AI allows us to be much more efficient and have scope, scale and reach that we\u2019ve never had before. But you better make sure that it\u2019s not embedding bias or destroying privacy along the way before you hit scale. And it has huge implications for work and for workers. If we get this right, it can empower workers by enabling them to do more and earn more, but that won\u2019t happen unless we pay attention. And that\u2019s what President Biden has been clear we must achieve: making sure that these technologies enable, not displace, workers.\n\ntitle4:\nIyo thinks its gen AI earbuds can succeed where Humane and Rabbit stumbled\ndescription4:\nA month after launching its first product, Humane\u2019s co-founders have reportedly put their well-funded startup on the market. While even the firm\u2019s biggest cheerleaders didn\u2019t expect the Ai Pin to change the world in such a short timeframe, few of its many detractors expected things to go so sideways, so quickly.\nHumane\u2019s biggest competitor, the Rabbit R1, didn\u2019t fare much better. Shortly after launch, the generative AI-fueled handheld was savaged by critics. The most salient critique of the \u201chalf-baked\u201d device was that it could been an app, rather than a $200 piece of hardware.\nThe excitement ahead of both devices\u2019 launch is proof-positive that there is interest in a new form factor that leverages LLMs (large language models) in a way that is genuinely useful in our daily lives. At the moment, however, it\u2019s safe to stay that no one has yet stuck the landing.\nIyo represents a third form factor in the push to deliver standalone generative AI devices. Unlike Humane, which attempted to introduce a wholly new form factor by way of a lapel pin, Iyo is building its technology into an already wildly successful category: the Bluetooth earbud.\nWhen the Iyo One launches this winter, the company will be able to build on several years of consumer education around the integration of assistants like Alexa and Siri into headphones. The leap from that to more sophisticated LLM-based models is far shorter than one like the Ai Pin, which requires a fundamental rethink of how we interact with our devices.\nMuch like Humane and Rabbit, Iyo\u2019s founding predates the current AI hype cycle. The company traces its history all the way back to the before times of 2019.\n\u201cI saw all these people I knew in AI, three different research orgs inside Google, all the external people, OpenAI and others all making this incredible progress with these language models, all independently,\u201d founder and CEO Jason Rugolo told TechCrunch. \u201cI realize it\u2019s algebra and data, and no one has a corner on either of those things. I saw that the foundational models were going to proliferate and become a commodity \u2014 very controversial in 2019.\u201d\nWhereas Humane was able to drum up a good bit of interest reliant on its founders\u2019 time at Apple, Iyo was actually formed inside Google. The firm was incubated inside the Alphabet X \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d that gave rise to projects like Glass and Project Loon. Iyo was spun off in 2021. Unlike X graduates Waymo, Wing and Intrinsic, however, the company does not operate as a subsidiary. Instead, Alphabet served as Iyo\u2019s first investor. As Rugolo is quick to point, the search giant does not occupy a seat on the company\u2019s board.\nYes, there was an Iyo TED Talk.

You can currently go to the firm\u2019s site and purchase a different \u2014 but related \u2014 audio device. The $1,650 Vad Pro is effectively a sophisticated in-ear studio reference monitor. The device sports a similar rounded form factor to the One, along with head-tracking, but Iyo\u2019s first commercially available device is wired.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re building in a digital audio workstation like Logic Pro,\u201d says Rugolo, \u201cit\u2019s paired with a piece of software we wrote that applies our virtualization technology.\u201d This is designed to help engineers create spatial audio mixes.\nThe Vad Pro speak to another important element of the Iyo One pitch: They\u2019re designed to be, above all, a premium set of headphones. Unlike the Ai Pin and R1, which offer no value outside their AI capabilities, the Iyo One can also simply function as a good pair of headphones.\nThe headphones are noticeably larger that standard Bluetooth earbuds. That\u2019s due, in part, to the inclusion of a significantly larger battery, which Rugolo says can get up to 16 hours on a charge when paired with a phone in Bluetooth mode. If you\u2019re using the One in cellular mode without a tethered handset, on the other hand, that number shrinks considerably to around an hour and a half.\nCost is a concern, as well. While the Iyo One will cost a fraction of the Vad Pro, it\u2019s still cheap at $599 for the Wi-Fi model and $699 for the cellular version. The latter puts it at the same price point as the Ai Pin and hundreds of dollars more than the R1. That\u2019s well out of the average consumer\u2019s range for buying a piece of hardware just to mess around with. Unlike the Ai Pin, however, the Iyo One will not require a monthly subscription fee.\nThe Vad Pro.

I don\u2019t like that model. It\u2019s not the best for customers.\u201d The cellular version will, however, require users to sign up for a plan with their carriers. That\u2019s just standard practice.\nAs Nura\u2019s eventual acquisition by Denon demonstrated, the Bluetooth earbud category is hard for a startup, regardless of how novel the underlying technology might be. Companies are competing with the industry\u2019s biggest names on one end, including Apple, Samsung and Google. On the other, you\u2019ve got pairs often designed by Chinese manufacturers that can be had for as little as $10 new.\nRugolo thinks, however, that the earbuds will provide value from day one. The Ai Pin and R1 have struggled to say the same.\n\u201cI think the key is delivering value immediately, right out of the box, focusing on the features you\u2019re going to ship with,\u201d the Iyo founder said. \u201cWe believe this is a platform, and we think there are going to be millions of what we call \u2018Audio-First Apps,\u2019 these AU apps. But people don\u2019t buy platforms. They buy products that do super useful stuff for them. So, just on the sound isolation, the comfort, the music quality alone, we think there\u2019s a very large market for these devices.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
