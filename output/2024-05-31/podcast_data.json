It\u2019s unclear why it took the company more than a week to publicly disclose the breach.\nLive Nation said in its statement that it \u201cidentified unauthorized activity within a third-party cloud database environment containing Company data.\u201d\nThe company did not name the third-party cloud database in its statement.\nA spokesperson for Ticketmaster, who would not provide their name but responded from the company\u2019s media email address, told TechCrunch that its stolen database was hosted on Snowflake, a Boston-based cloud storage and analytics company.\nTicketmaster\u2019s spokesperson did not say how the data was exfiltrated from Snowflake\u2019s systems.\nSnowflake said in a post on Friday that it had informed a \u201climited number of customers who we believe may have been impacted\u201d by attacks \u201ctargeting some of our customers\u2019 accounts.\u201d Snowflake did not describe the nature of the attacks, or if data had been stolen from customer accounts.\nSnowflake spokesperson Danica Stanczak declined to comment on the record about Ticketmaster\u2019s breach.\nAmazon Web Services also hosts much of Live Nation and Ticketmaster\u2019s infrastructure, according to a since-removed customer case study on Amazon\u2019s website.\nEarlier this week, the administrator of a since-revived popular cybercrime forum called BreachForums claimed to be selling the personal information of 560 million customers, including the alleged personal information of Ticketmaster customers, along with ticket sales and customer card information.\nUntil now, Live Nation had not commented on the data breach. Earlier this week, Australian authorities confirmed it was assisting Live Nation with a cybersecurity incident, and U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA deferred comment to Live Nation.\nTechCrunch on Friday obtained a portion of the allegedly stolen data containing thousands of records, including email addresses. This included several internal Ticketmaster email addresses used for testing, which are not public but appear as real Ticketmaster accounts. TechCrunch verified on Friday that the records we checked belong to Ticketmaster customers.\nTechCrunch checked the validity of these accounts by running the internal email addresses through Ticketmaster\u2019s sign-up form. All of the accounts came back as real. (Ticketmaster displays an error if someone enters an email address that is already a real Ticketmaster account.)\nEarlier in May, the Department of Justice and 30 attorneys general sued Live Nation to break up the ticketing conglomerate, accusing Live Nation of monopolistic practices.\nUpdated with response from Ticketmaster, and Snowflake\u2019s decline.\nDo you know more about the Live Nation TicketMaster breach?

The crypto exchange said it also \u201cimplemented restrictions on the use of some services to ensure additional safety,\u201d according to a machine translation of the company\u2019s official blog post (written in Japanese).\nThe company also promised that all customers\u2019 Bitcoin deposits \u201cwill be fully guaranteed as we will procure the equivalent amount of BTC that was leaked with support from our group companies.\u201d\nDMM Bitcoin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAccording to De.Fi, the web3 security firm that tracks crypto thefts and scams, hackers stole around $2 billion in crypto across dozens of cyberattacks and thefts last year. While that is still a gargantuan amount of crypto, the total was the lowest since 2020.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle admits its AI Overviews need work, but we're all helping it beta test\ndescription2:\nGoogle is embarrassed about its AI Overviews, too. After a deluge of dunks and memes over the past week, which cracked on the poor quality and outright misinformation that arose from the tech giant\u2019s underbaked new AI-powered search feature, the company on Thursday issued a mea culpa of sorts. Google \u2014 a company whose name is synonymous with searching the web \u2014 whose brand focuses on \u201corganizing the world\u2019s information\u201d and putting it at user\u2019s fingertips \u2014 actually wrote in a blog post that \u201csome odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up.\u201d\nThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\nThe admission of failure, penned by Google VP and Head of Search Liz Reid, seems a testimony as to how the drive to mash AI technology into everything has now somehow made Google Search worse.\nIn the post titled \u201cAbout last week,\u201d (this got past PR?), Reid spells out the many ways its AI Overviews make mistakes. While they don\u2019t \u201challucinate\u201d or make things up the way that other large language models (LLMs) may, she says, they can get things wrong for \u201cother reasons,\u201d like \u201cmisinterpreting queries, misinterpreting a nuance of language on the web, or not having a lot of great information available.\u201d\nReid also noted that some of the screenshots shared on social media over the past week were faked, while others were for nonsensical queries, like \u201cHow many rocks should I eat?\u201d \u2014 something no one ever really searched for before. Since there\u2019s little factual information on this topic, Google\u2019s AI guided a user to satirical content. (In the case of the rocks, the satirical content had been published on a geological software provider\u2019s website.)\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that if you had Googled \u201cHow many rocks should I eat?\u201d and were presented with a set of unhelpful links, or even a jokey article, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised. What people are reacting to is the confidence with which the AI spouted back that \u201cgeologists recommend eating at least one small rock per day\u201d as if it\u2019s a factual answer. It may not be a \u201challucination,\u201d in technical terms, but the end user doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s insane.\nWhat\u2019s unsettling, too, is that Reid claims Google \u201ctested the feature extensively before launch,\u201d including with \u201crobust red-teaming efforts.\u201d\nDoes no one at Google have a sense of humor then? No one thought of prompts that would generate poor results?\nIn addition, Google downplayed the AI feature\u2019s reliance on Reddit user data as a source of knowledge and truth. Although people have regularly appended \u201cReddit\u201d to their searches for so long that Google finally made it a built-in search filter, Reddit is not a body of factual knowledge. And yet the AI would point to Reddit forum posts to answer questions, without an understanding of when first-hand Reddit knowledge is helpful and when it is not \u2014 or worse, when it is a troll.\nReddit today is making bank by offering its data to companies like Google, OpenAI and others to train their models, but that doesn\u2019t mean users want Google\u2019s AI deciding when to search Reddit for an answer, or suggesting that someone\u2019s opinion is a fact. There\u2019s nuance to learning when to search Reddit and Google\u2019s AI doesn\u2019t understand that yet.\nAs Reid admits, \u201cforums are often a great source of authentic, first-hand information, but in some cases can lead to less-than-helpful advice, like using glue to get cheese to stick to pizza,\u201d she said, referencing one of the AI feature\u2019s more spectacular failures over the past week.\nGoogle AI overview suggests adding glue to get cheese to stick to pizza, and it turns out the source is an 11 year old Reddit comment from user F*cksmith \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/uDPAbsAKeO \u2014 Peter Yang (@petergyang) May 23, 2024\nIf last week was a disaster, though, at least Google is iterating quickly as a result \u2014 or so it says.\nThe company says it\u2019s looked at examples from AI Overviews and identified patterns where it could do better, including building better detection mechanisms for nonsensical queries, limiting the user of user-generated content for responses that could offer misleading advice, adding triggering restrictions for queries where AI Overviews were not helpful, not showing AI Overviews for hard news topics, \u201cwhere freshness and factuality are important,\u201d and adding additional triggering refinements to its protections for health searches.\nWith AI companies building ever-improving chatbots every day, the question is not on whether they will ever outperform Google Search for helping us understand the world\u2019s information, but whether Google Search will ever be able to get up to speed on AI to challenge them in return.\nAs ridiculous as Google\u2019s mistakes may be, it\u2019s too soon to count it out of the race yet \u2014 especially given the massive scale of Google\u2019s beta-testing crew, which is essentially anybody who uses search.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing quite like having millions of people using the feature with many novel searches,\u201d says Reid.\n\ntitle3:\nWarren Buffett worried about 'huge losses' in booming insurance market\ndescription3:\n\"There is an element of unpredictability that is very unsettling, and I understand where [Buffett] is coming from, but I think it is really hard to avoid cyber risk entirely,\" Glombicki said. He added though that there has still been no significant litigation that assigns culpability or tests the boundaries of the policies, and until the courts hear some culpability cases, some insurers may proceed more cautiously.\n\"Right now [cybersecurity insurance] is still a viable business model for many insurers,\" Glombicki said. It is still a tiny market, representing only one percent of all policies issued, according to Glombicki. Because the cybersecurity business is so small, it gives insurance companies latitude to implement various policies to see what is working, and what isn't, without a tremendous amount of exposure.\nIndustry analysts generally say while some of Berkshire's caution is warranted, the general state of the cybersecurity insurance marketplace is stabilizing as it becomes profitable. And Gerald Glombicki, a senior director in Fitch Rating's U.S. insurance group, points out that Berkshire Hathaway is issuing cybersecurity policies despite Buffett's caution. According to Fitch's analysis, Berkshire Hathaway is the sixth-largest issuer of such policies. Chubb, which Berkshire recently revealed a big investment in , and AIG are the largest.\n\"There's no place where that kind of a dilemma enters into more than cyber,\" Buffett said. \"You may get an aggregation of risks that you never dreamt of, and maybe worse than some earthquake happening someplace.\"\n\"That aggregation potential can be huge, and not being able to have a worst-case gap on it is what scares us,\" he said.\nCyber insurance has become \"a very fashionable product,\" Jain said at the annual meeting. And it's been a money maker for insurers, at least to date. He described current profitability as \"fairly high\" \u2014 at least 20% of the total premium ending up in the pockets of insurers. But at Berkshire, the message being sent to agents is one of caution. A primary reason is the difficulty in assessing how losses from a single occurrence don't spiral into an aggregation of potential cyber losses. Jain gave the hypothetical example of when a major cloud provider's platform \"comes to a standstill.\"\nOne of the messages that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's top insurance executive, Ajit Jain, sent to investors during the company's recent annual shareholder meeting in Omaha was that cyber insurance, while currently profitable, still has too many unknowns and risks for Berkshire, a huge player in the insurance market, to be fully comfortable underwriting.\nThe problem with writing many policies, even with a $1 million limit per policy, is if a \"single event\" turns out to affect 1,000 policies. \"You've written something that in no way we're getting the proper price for, and could break the company,\" Buffett said.\nWhile some notable leaders, like former Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff \u2014 who now runs a global security risk management firm \u2014 have called for a government cybersecurity backstop of some sort, most experts don't believe that is needed right now. Glombicki says that while the feds are looking at what role they can play, intervention likely won't happen until an incident prompts it.\nAny government involvement \"will probably happen after a big, expensive cyber-incident,\" he said. \"After September 11, the government put together a terrorist risk program. In cyber, we have not yet seen an attack of that scale. We are still in the stage of thinking about possible approaches.\"\nCyber insurance data shows growth and market confidence\nWhile the number of cybersecurity policies being written is small now, analysts don't expect it to stay that way.\n\"Rates are declining, which shows stability in the market,\" said Mark Friedlander, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. According to its data, cyber premiums are estimated to double over the next decade. In 2022, premiums totaled $11.9 billion. By 2025, Friedlander says, they are expected to double to $22.5 billion and increase to $33.3 billion by 2027.\n\"This is clearly one of the fastest-growing segments of insurance. More companies are writing cybersecurity policies than ever before,\" Friedlander said, attributing confidence among insurers to more sophisticated underwriting and stabilizing rates. He cited a 6% decline in cybersecurity insurance rates in the first quarter of 2024, following a 3% decline in 2024, as a clear signal that insurers feel more confident about jumping into the business.\n\"Most commercial insurance like auto, home, and life insurance have all been increasing, so the decline is significant. It is a sign of stability and a decline in claims severity,\" Friedlander said.\nAnd more insurers are entering the market because they have the tools and data to price the risk. \"If you can do it at sound rates, you will write that coverage,\" Friedlander said.\n'You're losing money'\nBuffett and his top insurance lieutenant don't agree. It's the insurance \"loss cost\" \u2014 what the cost of goods sold could potentially be \u2014 that has Berkshire on the fence with a bigger move into cyber insurance. Jain said losses have been \"fairly well contained\" to date \u2014 not exceeding 40 cents on the policy dollar over the past four to five years \u2014 but he added, \"there's not enough data to be able to hang your hat on and say what your true loss cost is.\"\nJain said that in most cases agents are Berkshire are discouraged from writing cyber insurance, unless they need to write it to satisfy specific client needs. And even if they do, Jain leaves them with this message: \"No matter how much you charge, you should tell yourself that each time you write a cyber insurance policy, you're losing money. We can argue about how much money you're losing, but the mindset should be you're not making money on it. ... And then we should go from there.\"\nGoogle Cloud says the risks are being overstated\nThere is a perception that cyber risk is rapidly changing and, therefore, too unpredictable to underwrite in a systematic way, says Monica Shokrai, head of business risk and insurance at Google Cloud. But she added that the perception doesn't match reality, and that the risk can largely be managed.\n\"We don't hold the same view as Warren Buffet on the topic,\" she said. In Google's view, the majority of cyber losses can be prevented or mitigated through basic cyber hygiene.\n\"By understanding security, you can get to a place where your controls are in a much better place, where the risk is more manageable,\" Shokrai said. Devastating attacks from nation-states, meanwhile, are in a separate category and have been rare. Insurers are already inoculating themselves from potential risk by making exclusions for certain catastrophic events. Many cybersecurity policies have coverage exemptions for nation-state attacks.\n\"What they are trying to do is remain resilient and solvent in the event of a widespread event; what they have done to manage that is put in exclusions,\" Shokrai said, and those include critical infrastructure, cyber war, and other widespread disruptive events.\nAmbiguities and subjectivities remain. What if someone is the victim of a cyberattack from a foreign-based gang that isn't officially tied to a nation-state but may have received some ancillary logistical support? Can an insurance company invoke a nation-state exclusion? Shokrai says categorizing how to attribute an event is the topic of much debate between insurance companies. \"That is a big debate between insurance companies; it is an important distinction that needs clarity,\" Shokrai said.\nSome experts say it is the ambiguity surrounding the industry's margins that has investors like Buffett and insurance players like Berkshire spooked. But so far, the business has proven to be sound overall. \"It is still a viable business model for many insurers,\" said Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, who has been studying the evolving market for the past several years. But she added that a belief that the business is viable doesn't mean things are not constantly changing, pointing to the recent ransomware surge over the past couple of years that saw large payouts by insurance companies \u2014 though notably still not enough to make the business unprofitable for most issuers.\nCyber insurance helps make the entire ecosystem safer, according to Steve Griffin, co-founder of L3 Networks, a California-based managed services provider that specializes in cybersecurity. Policies require companies to adhere to certain cyber standards to attain coverage, and the more businesses that sign up for coverage, the safer the entire system becomes. And if a business knows they'll be denied a claim if they don't have some basic cybersecurity safeguards in place, that acts as an incentive to put them in place.\nBerkshire does believe the business will grow, it just isn't sure at what cost. \"My guess is at some point it might become a huge business, but it might be associated with huge losses,\" Jain said.\n\"I will tell you that most people want to be in anything that's fashionable when they write insurance. And cyber's an easy issue,\" Buffett said. \"You can write a lot of it. The agents like it. They're getting the commission on every policy they write. ... I would say that human nature is such that most insurance companies will get very excited and their agents will get very excited, and it's very fashionable and it's kind of interesting, and as Charlie [Munger] would say, it may be rat poison.\"\nWhile Griffin understands Buffett's caution, he sees a generational divide over the risk outlook, and is optimistic about the cybersecurity insurance sector.\n\"Probably Warren Buffet would have called cybersecurity insurance an opportunity when he was younger,\" he said.\n\ntitle4:\nDell shares tumble after first-quarter earnings report\ndescription4:\nDell Technologies CEO Michael Dell speaks during the MWC session 'New strategies for a new era' on the first day of the 18th edition of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) at Fira de Barcelona's Gran Via venue in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat on February 26, 2024, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.\nShares of Dell Technologies closed down nearly 18% Friday after investors were discouraged by the company's lower-than-expected artificial intelligence server backlog and an estimated decline in margins.\nDell reported fiscal first-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts' expectations and offered rosy guidance. The company said revenue for the period was $22.24 billion, which was up from the $21.64 billion estimated by analysts according to LSEG.\nFor its second quarter, Dell said it expects earnings of $1.65 per share, and it expects sales to come in between $23.5 billion and $24.5 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $23.35 billion. Dell guided for between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion in sales for the full fiscal year.\nThe beat wasn't enough to appease investors, and shares tumbled in extended trading Thursday.\nBernstein analysts said the \"principle disappointment\" in Dell's results was that operating margins for its Infrastructure Solutions Group compressed year over year. Additionally, operating profits were flat compared with the same period last year, even though the company brought in around $1.7 billion in incremental AI server revenues.\nThe analysts said this resurfaced concerns that Dell's AI servers are being sold at \"near-zero margins.\" In other words, the company's AI initiatives are not translating into profits yet.\n\"On net, relative to very high expectations, Dell's Q1 25 results were disappointing,\" the analysts wrote in a note Friday.\nBank of America analysts said Dell reported a strong quarter, and they reiterated their buy rating on the stock. However, they said the after-hours move was partly because Dell's AI server backlog of $3.8 billion was lower than estimates, and the company's growth margin is expected to decline in the fiscal year.\n\"We reiterate Buy given that we are still in the early stages of AI adoption with continued strong pipeline and momentum around AI servers, where we think DELL will be able to capture higher AI margins over time,\" the analysts said in a note Thursday.\nJPMorgan analysts said they were not surprised by the investor reaction to the report but added that they believe the concerns are \"overblown.\" They maintained their overweight rating on the stock and said Dell's margin choppiness is set to create an attractive buying opportunity.\nThe analysts said the company is on track to expand both revenue and earnings ahead of its medium-term target, and they expect Dell will see accelerating AI demand trends and a recovery in its traditional infrastructure.\n\"We expect investors to be disappointed given lofty expectations of a ramp with greater flow-through to the bottom-line, and we would expect an overhang with investors more likely to monitor execution to the promised margin improvement through the remainder of the year,\" they wrote in a note Thursday.\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Kif Leswing contributed to this report.\"\n\nResponse:",
