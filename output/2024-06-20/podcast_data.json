And that\u2019s why we are compelled to take the action that we\u2019re taking today,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a call with reporters.\nNews of the ban was first reported by Reuters ahead of the announcement. A Kaspersky spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nKaspersky will be banned from selling its software to American consumers and businesses starting on July 20, but the company will be able to provide software and security updates to existing customers until September 29. After that, Kaspersky will no longer be permitted to push software updates to U.S. customers, according to Raimondo.\n\u201cThat means your software and services will degrade. That\u2019s why I strongly recommend that you immediately find an alternative to Kaspersky,\u201d Raimondo said.\nRaimondo said that U.S. consumers who already use Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus are not violating the law.\n\u201cU.S. individuals and businesses that continue to use or have existing Kaspersky products and services are not in violation of the law, you have done nothing wrong and you are not subject to any criminal or civil penalties,\u201d said Raimondo. \u201cHowever, I would encourage you in the strongest possible terms, to immediately stop using that software and switch to an alternative in order to protect yourself and your data and your family.\u201d\nTo inform consumers, Raimondo said the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department will work to notify U.S. consumers, and the U.S. government will set up a website, \u201cso people who are impacted can find the information they need to understand why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, and help them take next steps.\u201d\nA senior U.S. Commerce Department official said during the press call that federal cybersecurity agency CISA will do outreach to critical infrastructure organizations that use Kaspersky software in their operations to help them find alternatives. The official also said that they don\u2019t plan on naming any specific action by Kaspersky that led to today\u2019s decision. (The Commerce Department asked reporters not to name the official.)\nThe ban announced Thursday is the latest escalation in a long series of U.S. government actions against the Moscow-headquartered Kaspersky.\nIn September 2017, the Trump administration banned U.S. federal agencies from using Kaspersky software over fears that the company could be compelled to help Russian intelligence agencies. Earlier in the year, it was reported that Russian government hackers had stolen U.S. classified documents stored on an intelligence contractor\u2019s home computer because it was running Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus, marking the first known incident of espionage resulting from use of the company\u2019s software.\nThe decision to ban Kaspersky has been in the works since last year, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal in April 2023.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the company has more than 400 million individual customers, and over 240,000 corporate customers worldwide. The senior official declined to say how many U.S. customers Kaspersky has, but said there is a significant number, including critical infrastructure organizations, and state and local government entities.\n\ntitle1:\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI announced\ndescription1:\nIn this article AMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nJakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nOpenAI competitor Anthropic on Thursday announced Claude 3.5 Sonnet, its most powerful artificial intelligence model yet. Claude is one of the chatbots that, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google 's Gemini, has exploded in popularity in the past year. Anthropic, which was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, has backers including Google, Salesforce and Amazon . In the past year, it's closed five different funding deals totaling about $7.3 billion. The news follows Anthropic's debut of its Claude 3 family of models in March and OpenAI's GPT-4o in May. The company said Claude 3.5 Sonnet is faster than its previous leading model, Claude 3 Opus, and is the first model from Anthropic's new Claude 3.5 family.\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet is free from the company's website, Claude.ai, and in the Claude iPhone app. Claude Pro and Team subscribers can access the latest model with higher rate limits. \"It shows marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone,\" the company said in a blog post. It can also write, edit and execute code. Anthropic also announced \"Artifacts,\" which it said allows a user to ask its Claude chatbot to, for example, generate a text document or code and then opens the result in a dedicated window. \"This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude's creations in real-time,\" the company said, adding that it expects Artifacts will be useful for code development, legal contract drafting and analysis, business report writing and more.\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Claude Artifacts\n\ntitle2:\nPoolside is raising $400M+ at a $2B valuation to build a supercharged coding co-pilot\ndescription2:\nParis has quickly established itself as a major European center for AI startups, and now another deal in the works could cement that position even further.\nPoolside.ai, a generative AI company based out of Paris that is building tools to speed up software development, is in the process of raising at least $400 million, on a post-money valuation of $2 billion, sources tell TechCrunch.\nBain Capital Ventures and DST are in talks to co-lead the round at the moment, sources tell us. BCV is a previous backer of the company, and DST is a new investor. Bain\u2019s participation has been previously reported, with PitchBook noting this to be an estimated $450 million round.\nPoolside made a splash (ahem) last August when it became yet another AI startup in the city to raise a big seed round. It picked up $126 million from backers that included, in addition to BCV, early stage specialists like London\u2019s Air Street, Abstraction and Scribble Ventures, and New Wave and Frst from France. Bpifrance, Felicis, Point Nine, and Redpoint were also in the round. None of the investors we contacted would comment for this story. Poolside\u2019s CEO did not respond to our request for comment.\nMistral and H, two foundational model companies, are among those that have also raised 9-figure seed rounds (respectively $113 million and $220 million) out of the city. The City of Light might need to be renamed the City of AI at this rate.\nLooking at the bigger picture, it feels at times like the market has gotten very overheated, very fast, for AI startups, which collectively are raising many of billions of dollars when you also include the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI. Do we need another foundational AI company, you might ask?\nThere are a number of reasons why Poolside is getting this level of funding to take its own big swing at the generative AI opportunity:\n\u2013 Strength of founding team and its connection to the company\u2019s premise. Both are steeped in the world of developer tools and DevOps. One founder, CEO Jason Warner, was the CTO of GitHub and led engineering for Heroku and Canonical. The other, CTO Eiso Kant, previously founded Athenian, which had built a series of tools for developers to help them optimise how they build and work. (That company was acquired by the Linux Foundation for an undisclosed sum.) Warner was also previously a VC at Redpoint and knows the value and language of the interaction between VCs and founders.\n\u2013 The problem being solved. Unlike those building foundational LLM models that are more generalized in their approach, Poolside (for now at least) is looking at one use case in particular: helping developers work faster. This will resonate with investors, and is reminiscent of a memorable essay written by Paul Graham many years ago about startup ideas, building tools that you yourself know you would need, which by default means that founders and likely other technologists should need.\nAlthough the likes of Mistral also have a focus on developers and developer tools, not to mention Microsoft\u2019s adaptation of OpenAI for GitHub (indeed OpenAI is all about its APIs which are also used by developers), there have been some notable examples of how code is one of the more problematic blind spots (again, for now at least) for more general LLMs. Right now, there is a window of opportunity to build this, and build it better than a more generalist approach.\nThat\u2019s not to say that Poolside is not also thinking big. In a three-step plan outlined on its website, it notes that eventually it hopes to work, after developers, with anyone who wants to write code and software; and then, after that, \u201cGeneralize these capabilities beyond software to all other fields.\u201d NBD!\n\u2013 Early signs of what they have built. What I have not seen is whether the company has released a product yet in general availability, but there is some evidence that they are working and growing (and perhaps running in private beta?). Its compute supplier, IREN, in April reported that Poolside had ramped up its cloud services deal with the company.\n\u2013 Last but certainly not least, there is monetization. As one source close to the company said to me, there are many examples of AI addressing different areas of the market, but not many have clear indications \u2013 much less proof \u2013 of monetization potential. (Yes, the big deal that OpenAI inked with PwC could open the door to more enterprise business, but that might be a years-long effort; meanwhile, it remains to be seen what take-up at any enterprise might look like.)\nWith Poolside, however, if you consider the opportunity and scale of building co-pilot tools for developers, it may well be one of the best and most straightfoward places to apply AI, if done right. It\u2019s a clear, large need and all computer programming has syntax, so it\u2019s not nearly as open-ended as so many other areas where AI is being applied. Plus, it has constraints, and indications of performance, and benchmarks \u2013 a winning combination for investors and startups looking to build businesses.\nWe\u2019ll update this post as we learn more.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon's ditching the plastic air pillows in its boxes\ndescription3:\nAmazon said Thursday it has removed 95% of the plastic air pillows from its packaging in North America and will replace them with paper fillers made from 100% recycled content.\nIt marks Amazon's largest plastic-packaging reduction effort and will help it remove nearly 15 billion plastic pillows annually.\n\"We are working towards full removal in North America by end of year and will continue to innovate, test, and scale in order to prioritize curbside recyclable materials,\" VP of Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging Pat Lindner said in the announcement.\nThe e-commerce company began transitioning away from plastic filler in October 2023 when it announced its first U.S. automated fulfillment center to eliminate plastic-delivery packaging. Amazon collaborated with suppliers to instead source paper fillers that are also curbside recyclable.\nThis is not the first step that Amazon has taken to reduce its packaging waste. In 2015, the company launched the Ships in Product Packaging program, an initiative designed to reduce the use of Amazon's signature brown box and instead ship products in their original packaging.\n\ntitle4:\nUS car dealerships face ongoing outage after CDK cyberattacks\ndescription4:\nAuto retailers and car dealerships across the U.S. are facing another day of outages after a second cyberattack hit tech company CDK Global, which develops software used for managing auto customers and their vehicles.\nIn a message from CDK sent to customers Thursday, the company said the additional cyberattack late Wednesday may result in extended outages.\n\u201cAt this time, we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution and therefore our dealers\u2019 systems will not be available at a minimum on Thursday,\u201d the message read.\nCDK said that its customer support teams \u201cremain unavailable\u201d as a precautionary measure to maintain security.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney confirmed the second incident and another shutdown of \u201cmost of our systems.\u201d\n\u201cIn partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\u201d said Finney.\nThe company\u2019s website says its software runs in about 15,000 dealerships.\nNews of the cyberattack broke early Wednesday as car dealerships reported outages with their CDK-run dealer management systems, which allow dealers to handle customer appointments, vehicle records and other information. Several CDK customers took to social media and Reddit saying the outages forced staff to find workarounds that do not rely on the downed software.\nCDK did not describe the nature of the initial cyberattack, but said that CDK shut down all of its systems on Wednesday. Some CDK functions began to return on Wednesday afternoon, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the ongoing cyberattack. It\u2019s not clear if, or how, the second cyberattack is related to the first.\nCDK did not answer TechCruch\u2019s specific questions about the incidents, including if it\u2019s aware of any exfiltration of data from its systems. It\u2019s not yet clear if the company has the ability to determine what customer data, if any, was stolen.\nUpdated on June 20 at 1 p.m. ET with CDK\u2019s latest statement.\nDo you know more about the CDK cyberattacks?
