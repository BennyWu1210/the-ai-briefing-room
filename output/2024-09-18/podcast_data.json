Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said he hopes Veo will enable creators to produce more Shorts videos with the help of AI.\n\"Everything that we showed with AI was meant to really enhance the work that you do, make it faster, more efficient, to bring your creative ideas to life faster,\" said Mohan, speaking at the Made on YouTube event in New York.\nThe Veo AI backgrounds are an upgrade over a similar AI-generation feature announced by YouTube in 2023 called Dream Screen. The company said its Veo AI background feature will roll out later this year, while the six-second AI clips will become available in 2025.\nOther announcements at the event included new features in the YouTube Studio app that will allow creators to use AI to generate titles, thumbnails and video ideas. Those features will roll out in late 2024, YouTube said.\nCreators have been exploring various ways to leverage generative AI technology. Creators have used the new technology to insert clips in their videos or produce entirely AI-generated videos.\nHowever, some creators expressed concerns that their videos on YouTube are used to train the AI models that built Veo.\n\"I don't know how I feel about all this AI stuff,\" said Thomas Simons, a comedian with more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube. \"It doesn't fill me with confidence and love.\"\nThere has been criticism that other services such as Facebook have become overrun by spammy, AI-generated content. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate intellectual property protections.\nYouTube's AI-generated content will be watermarked and will have a label indicating it was created by AI, the company said.\nGenerative AI places a new perspective on the creator economy, giving creators free access to tools utilized by large language models.\nWe \"really sit at the nexus of that technology and creativity,\" Mohan said. \"Putting those two things together gives us this unique lens that everything we build is really about enhancing that human creativity.\"\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon bumps average warehouse pay and adds free Prime membership perk\ndescription1:\nAmazon announced Wednesday it is raising wages for its hourly warehouse workers and adding a new employee perk that will give them a Prime subscription at no extra cost.\nBeginning this month, Amazon's average base pay for front-line employees in the U.S. will be bumped to an average of more than $22 an hour, up from roughly $20.50 an hour, the company said.\nAmazon said it is also making its Prime subscription service a part of employees' benefit package beginning \"early next year.\" The service, which costs $140 a year, gives members access to speedy shipping and video streaming, among other perks.\nLast week, Amazon also hiked wages for its contracted delivery drivers to roughly $22 an hour as part of a $2.1 billion investment this year into its third-party logistics program.\nThe wage hikes come as Amazon is preparing to enter the peak holiday shopping season, a period when retailers typically see a flurry of online shopping. Amazon said Tuesday it plans to host a second Prime Day-like deal bonanza on Oct. 8-9, the third year it has held the discount event.\n\ntitle2:\nLinkedIn is training AI models on your data\ndescription2:\nIf you\u2019re on LinkedIn, then you should know that the social network has, without asking, opted accounts into training generative AI models. 404Media reports that LinkedIn introduced the new privacy setting and opt-out form before rolling out an updated privacy policy saying that data from the platform is being used to train AI models. As TechCrunch notes, it has since updated the policy.\nWe may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others.\nLinkedIn writes on a help page that it uses generative AI for purposes like writing assistant features. You can revoke permission by heading to the Data privacy tab in your account settings and clicking on \u201cData for Generative AI Improvement\u201d to find the toggle. Turn it to \u201coff\u201d to opt-out.\nAccording to LinkedIn: \u201cOpting out means that LinkedIn and its affiliates won\u2019t use your personal data or content on LinkedIn to train models going forward, but does not affect training that has already taken place.\u201d\nThe FAQ posted for its AI training says it uses \u201cprivacy enhancing technologies to redact or remove personal data\u201d from its training sets, and that it doesn\u2019t train its models on those who live in the EU, EEA, or Switzerland.\nIf you see this, you\u2019re in the right place for opting out. Screenshot: LinkedIn\nThat setting is for data used to train generative AI models, but LinkedIn has other machine learning tools at work for things like personalization and moderation that don\u2019t generate content. To opt your data out of being used to train those, you\u2019ll have to also fill out the LinkedIn Data Processing Objection Form.\n\ntitle3:\nCourt backs Google's challenge to the EU's $1.7 billion antitrust fine\ndescription3:\nA Google logo displays on a smartphone screen and the European flag on a computer screen.\nThe European Union's second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.\nThe case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.\nGoogle acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.\nBut the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.\nThe commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU's General Court.\n\ntitle4:\nThis Week in AI: Why OpenAI's o1 changes the AI regulation game\ndescription4:\nHiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch\u2019s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.\nIt\u2019s been just a few days since OpenAI revealed its latest flagship generative model, o1, to the world. Marketed as a \u201creasoning\u201d model, o1 essentially takes longer to \u201cthink\u201d about questions before answering them, breaking down problems and checking its own answers.\nThere\u2019s a great many things o1 can\u2019t do well \u2014 and OpenAI itself admits this. But on some tasks, like physics and math, o1 excels despite not necessarily having more parameters than OpenAI\u2019s previous top-performing model, GPT-4o. (In AI and machine learning, \u201cparameters,\u201d usually in the billions, roughly correspond to a model\u2019s problem-solving skills.)\nAnd this has implications for AI regulation.\nCalifornia\u2019s proposed bill SB 1047, for example, imposes safety requirements on AI models that either cost over $100 million to develop or were trained using compute power beyond a certain threshold. Models like o1, however, demonstrate that scaling up training compute isn\u2019t the only way to improve a model\u2019s performance.\nIn a post on X, Nvidia research manager Jim Fan posited that future AI systems may rely on small, easier-to-train \u201creasoning cores\u201d as opposed to the training-intensive architectures (e.g., Meta\u2019s Llama 405B) that\u2019ve been the trend lately. Recent academic studies, he notes, have shown that small models like o1 can greatly outperform large models given more time to noodle on questions.\nSo was it short-sighted for policymakers to tie AI regulatory measures to compute? Yes, says Sara Hooker, head of AI startup Cohere\u2019s research lab, in an interview with TechCrunch:\n[o1] kind of points out how incomplete a viewpoint this is, using model size as a proxy for risk. It doesn\u2019t take into account everything you can do with inference or running a model. For me, it\u2019s a combination of bad science combined with policies that put the emphasis on not the current risks that we see in the world now, but on future risks.\nNow, does that mean legislators should rip AI bills up from their foundations and start over? No. Many were written to be easily amendable, under the assumption that AI would evolve far beyond their enactment. California\u2019s bill, for instance, would give the state\u2019s Government Operations Agency the authority to redefine the compute thresholds that trigger the law\u2019s safety requirements.\nThe admittedly tricky part will be figuring out which metric could be a better proxy for risk than training compute. Like so many other aspects of AI regulation, it\u2019s something to ponder as bills around the U.S. \u2014 and world \u2014 march toward passage.\nNews\nImage Credits: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\nFirst reactions to o1: Max got initial impressions from AI researchers, startup founders, and VCs on o1 \u2014 and tested the model himself.\nAltman departs safety committee: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped down from the startup\u2019s committee responsible for reviewing the safety of models such as o1, likely in response to concerns that he wouldn\u2019t act impartially.\nSlack turns into an agent hub: At its parent company Salesforce\u2019s annual Dreamforce conference, Slack announced new features, including AI-generated meeting summaries and integrations with tools for image generation and AI-driven web searches.\nGoogle begins flagging AI images: Google says that it plans to roll out changes to Google Search to make clearer which images in results were AI generated \u2014 or edited by AI tools.\nMistral launches a free tier: French AI startup Mistral launched a new free tier to let developers fine-tune and build test apps with the startup\u2019s AI models.\nSnap launches a video generator: At its annual Snap Partner Summit on Tuesday, Snapchat announced that it\u2019s introducing a new AI video-generation tool for creators. The tool will allow select creators to generate AI videos from text prompts and, soon, from image prompts.\nIntel inks major chip deal: Intel says it will co-develop an AI chip with AWS using Intel\u2019s 18A chip fabrication process. The companies described the deal as a \u201cmulti-year, multi-billion-dollar framework\u201d that could potentially involve additional chip designs.\nOprah\u2019s AI special: Oprah Winfrey aired a special on AI with guests such as OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, tech influencer Marques Brownlee, and current FBI director Christopher Wray.\nResearch paper of the week\nWe know that AI can be persuasive, but can it dig out someone deep in a conspiracy rabbit hole? Well, not all by itself. But a new model from Costello et al. at MIT and Cornell can make a dent in beliefs about untrue conspiracies that persists for at least a couple months.\nIn the experiment, they had people who believed in conspiracy-related statements (e.g., \u201c9/11 was an inside job\u201d) talk with a chatbot that gently, patiently, and endlessly offered counterevidence to their arguments. These conversations led the humans involved to stating a 20% reduction in the associated belief two months later, at least as far as these things can be measured. Here\u2019s an example of one of the conversations in progress:\nIt\u2019s unlikely that those deep into reptilians and deep state conspiracies are likely to consult or believe an AI like this, but the approach could be more effective if it were used at a critical juncture like a person\u2019s first foray into these theories. For instance, if a teenager searches for \u201cCan jet fuel melt steel beams?\u201d they may be experience a learning moment instead of a tragic one.\nModel of the week\nIt\u2019s not a model, but it has to do with models: Researchers at Microsoft this week published an AI benchmark called Eureka aimed at (in their words) \u201cscaling up [model] evaluations \u2026 in an open and transparent manner.\u201d\nAI benchmarks are a dime a dozen. So what makes Eureka different? Well, the researchers say that, for Eureka \u2014 which is actually a collection of existing benchmarks \u2014 they chose tasks that remain challenging for \u201ceven the most capable models.\u201d Specifically, Eureka tests for capabilities often overlooked in AI benchmarks, like visual-spatial navigation skills.\nTo show just how difficult Eureka can be for models, the researchers tested systems, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Meta\u2019s Llama, on the benchmark. No single model scored well across all of Eureka\u2019s tests, which the researchers say underscores the importance of \u201ccontinued innovation\u201d and \u201ctargeted improvements\u201d to models.\nGrab bag\nIn a win for professional actors, California passed two laws, AB 2602 and AB 1836, restricting the use of AI digital replicas.\nThe legislation, which was backed by SAG-AFTRA, the performers\u2019 union, requires that companies relying on a performer\u2019s digital replica (e.g., cloned voice or image) give a \u201creasonably specific\u201d description of the replica\u2019s intended use and negotiate with the performer\u2019s legal counsel or labor union. It also requires that entertainment employers gain the consent of a deceased performer\u2019s estate before using a digital replica of that person.\nAs the Hollywood Reporter notes in its coverage, the bills codify concepts that SAG-AFTRA fought for in its 118-day strike last year with studios and major streaming platforms. California is the second state after Tennessee to impose restrictions on the use of digital actor likenesses; SAG-AFTRA also sponsored the Tennessee effort.\"\n\nResponse:",
