 Senate passes a bill forcing TikTok to face a ban if ByteDance doesn't sell it
The Senate passed a bill, included with the foreign aid package, that will ban TikTok if its owner, ByteDance, doesn’t sell it within a year. Senators passed the bill 79-18 Tuesday after the House passed it with overwhelming majority over the weekend.
President Joe Biden will have to sign the bill to make it law, and as per a statement released by the White House, he intends to do so on Wednesday.
Notably, in March, the House passed a similar standalone bill to ban TikTok or force its sale with a six-month time limit. However, the Senate never took that bill up. This time, as the bill was tied with critical foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, the Senate had to make a decision.
TikTok didn’t immediately release a statement. However, Michael Beckerman, the company’s head of public policy for the Americas, said that the company plans to challenge the move in courts, according to Bloomberg.
“This is an unprecedented deal worked out between the Republican Speaker and President Biden. The stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,” he said in a memo to TikTok’s US staff earlier this week.
The bill gives Bytedance nine months to force a sale with a 90-day extension — so effectively a year to complete the deal.
Last week, when the House passed the bill, TikTok said it was “unfortunate” that the House was using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to jam through a ban bill that restricts the “free speech rights of 170 million Americans.”
It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform… — TikTok Policy (@TikTokPolicy) April 18, 2024
While TikTok operates out of Singapore, the U.S. has been concerned about the data of its citizens, given the Chinese ownership of the social media platform. TikTok has continually tried to assure the government that it doesn’t give out U.S. user data to China with different campaigns.

Tesla profits drop 55%, company says EV sales 'under pressure' from hybrids
Tesla profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter from the same year-ago period as a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and “several unforeseen challenges” cut into the automaker’s bottom line.
Tesla reported revenue of $21.3 billion in the first quarter, a 9% drop from the first quarter of 2023. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance expected earnings of $0.51 per share on $22.15 billion in revenue. Tesla reported operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, a 54% decrease from the same year-ago period.
The company said in its Q1 earnings report that it experienced “numerous challenges” in the first quarter, including the Red Sea conflict and the arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin and the gradual ramp of the updated Model 3 at its factory in Fremont, California. Tesla also noted that global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs. On the upside, that hybrid approach has meant automakers continue to buy regulatory credits; Tesla earned $442 million in zero emissions tax credits in the first quarter.
“The EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug in hybrids instead,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in opening remarks on the earnings call. “We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.”
Shares pop on future promises
The results, posted after markets closed Tuesday, sent shares up as much as 12% following the release as investors appeared to be more focused on Tesla’s forward-looking remarks about future products, including an upended product roadmap to bring multiple cheaper vehicles to market by 2025.
Despite the downward trend in profits, Tesla used the first-quarter report to focus on the future, namely about using AI to make advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on a next-generation vehicle platform. The company spent $1.1 billion on research and development in the first quarter, a 49% increase from the same quarter in 2023.
Musk emphasized that despite the downward pressure, the company was focused on — and investing in — the future. Specifically, the company is accelerating work on a new vehicle lineup with production expected in early 2025, if not late this year, Musk said.
“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms,” he said. “And we’ll be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.”
The cost of price cuts
Tesla has seen EV sales grow over the past several years, topping out to a new record of 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. But the company’s profits have suffered thanks to repeated price cuts that started in late 2022.
While those price cuts did provide a temporary bump in sales, it hasn’t had a lasting effect. Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024, down 20% from the 484,507 it delivered in the final quarter of 2023. This wasn’t just a quarter-over-quarter blip either; Tesla delivered 8.5% fewer cars than the first quarter of 2023. Automotive gross margins, excluding regulatory credits, shrank to 16.35% in the first quarter compared to 18.96% in the same year-ago period.
Tesla warned in January that growth of its vehicle sales “may be notably lower” in 2024, noting at that time it was between “two major growth waves” and prepping for the launch of a new vehicle platform to build a smaller EV that costs around $25,000. The company has also been prepping a “robotaxi” built on the same platform. In the meantime, Tesla’s only new model is the expensive (and fussy) Cybertruck; the company has launched new variants on existing models, including the Tesla Model 3 Performance.
Musk said during the company’s earnings call in January the smaller and cheaper EV would go into production in late 2025 at the company’s factory in Texas and eventually expand to a yet-to-be-built factory in Mexico.
Three months later, Musk appears to have changed the company’s low-cost EV playbook. Musk reportedly replaced the plan for a low-cost EV purpose-built on the new platform. Instead, he now wants to plow headlong into the robotaxi, which will be revealed in some capacity in August, while also launching “new models” that somehow use what’s being developed for that new platform.
Less than two weeks after announcing the robotaxi launch date, Musk oversaw a 10% reduction in headcount and a restructuring that puts autonomy in sharp focus. Two high-profile executives — Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development — also left the company. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tuesday during the earnings call that the savings generated from the workforce reduction is expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual basis.
Other revenue sources
While automotive revenues fell, there were gains in other parts of the business, notably energy storage.
The company reported that energy storage deployments increased to a record 4.1 GWh. That pushed revenue for energy generation (meaning solar) and storage to 1.6 billion in the first quarter, a 7% increase from the same quarter last year. Tesla noted that most of that growth came from increased Megapack deployments, which was partially offset by a decrease in solar installs.
The company also reported $2.28 billion in revenue from services, including capital generated from its Supercharger network. That revenue source should increase as more automakers, including Ford, GM, Rivian and VW adopt Tesla’s technology known as North American Charging Standard.
Tesla Semi delayed
While Tesla pushes forward on autonomy and a new product roadmap, other projects continue to be delayed. Mass production of the Tesla Semi, which was first revealed in November 2017, is now being pushed out another year.
The Tesla Semi, which was originally planned to go into production in 2019, has been repeatedly delayed. The company did reveal a production-ready Semi in December 2022 and delivered a handful to Pepsi, its first customer, for a pilot. But it has yet to scale up volume production.
Last June, Musk said the company wouldn’t begin producing the Class 8 big rig until the end of 2024. The first production Semi vehicles are now planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026, according to Tesla.
Tesla is finalizing the engineering for the Semi to allow for “super cost effective high production,” according to information shared on the call. The company shared in its first-quarter earnings report that it has started construction of a Tesla Semi factory near its so-called Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada.

Apple’s next iPad event is May 7
Apple just dropped an invite for its next event. Scheduled for May 7, the “Let Loose” presentation appears to be happening exclusively online — something that became standard fare for the company during the pandemic. Over the last couple of years, however, Apple has returned to in-person events, including WWDC, which kicks off in Cupertino on June 10.
If this one is, indeed, online only, it’s likely to be on the smaller side, focusing on one or two select products. The company is no doubt saving some bigger news for its developer conference, happening almost exactly a month later.
The artwork features a prominent image of a hand holding an Apple Pencil, accompanied by the apparently handwritten tagline, “Let Loose.” We’re way overdue for a new iPad or four, as the company hasn’t updated the tablet line since 2022. M2 and M3 chips are strong possibilities, heading to the iPad Pro and iPad Air models, respectively.
As for the Pencil, this month’s early iOS 17.5 beta includes a reference to a “squeeze” feature for the upcoming fourth-generation version of Apple’s stylus. Other rumored upgrades include an updated version of the Pro’s Magic Keyboard case.
The event kicks off May 7 at 7 a.m. PT. Stay tuned to TechCrunch for more info.

Oracle is moving its world HQ to Nashville
Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman of Oracle, speaks during the Oracle OpenWorld 2017 conference in San Francisco on Oct. 3, 2017.
Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the company is moving its world headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee, to be closer to a major health-care epicenter.
In a wide-ranging conversation with Bill Frist, a former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Ellison said Oracle is moving a "huge campus" to Nashville, "which will ultimately be our world headquarters." He said Nashville is an established health center and a "fabulous place to live," one that Oracle employees are excited about.
"It's the center of the industry we're most concerned about, which is the health-care industry," Ellison said.
The announcement was seemingly spur-of-the-moment. "I shouldn't have said that," Ellison told Frist, a longtime health-care industry veteran who represented Tennessee in the Senate. The pair spoke during a fireside chat at the Oracle Health Summit in Nashville.
Shares of Oracle were mostly flat in extended trading Tuesday.
Oracle moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, in 2020. The company has been making a major push into health care in recent years, most notably with its $28 billion acquisition of the medical records software giant Cerner. Ellison said Tuesday that Oracle is relatively new to the health-care sector, but he believes the company has a "moral obligation" to solve problems facing the industry.
Nashville has been a major player in the health-care scene for decades, and the city is now home to a vibrant network of health systems, startups and investment firms. The city's reputation as a health-care hub was catalyzed when HCA Healthcare, one of the first for-profit hospital companies in the U.S., was founded there in 1968.
HCA helped attract troves of health-care professionals to Nashville, and other organizations quickly followed suit. Oracle has been developing its new $1.2 billion campus in the city for about three years, according to The Tennessean.
"Our people love it here, and we think it's the center of our future," Ellison said.
Oracle did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Perplexity is raising $250M+ at a $2.5B-$3B valuation for its AI search platform, sources say
Perplexity, the AI search engine startup, is a hot property at the moment. TechCrunch has learned that the company is currently raising at least $250 million more at a valuation of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.
The news comes on the heels of two other big fundraises that have seen the company’s valuation leapfrog in the last four months: In January, the company raised nearly $74 million at a valuation of $540 million (up from $121 million in April 2023). And at the beginning of March, the company closed funding on a valuation of $1 billion, with CEO Aravind Srinivas clarifying on Twitter today that the amount raised was roughly $63 million.
Those two reported rounds are not the full story. We understand from multiple sources close to the company that Perplexity is raising a further round of at least $250 million to capitalize on the attention it’s getting in the market. NEA and IVP, both previous backers of the company, are among those looking to invest in this larger round, according to sources.
Whether they or other previous backers participate, a source said, may depend on how willing Perplexity is to work with existing investors rather than diversify, expanding its cap table to bring in new investors.
“They are growing very rapidly,” a partner from an existing investor said. “Yes we will look to participate.”
The core of Perplexity’s product is a generative AI-based search engine that provides results using a chatbot-style interface. It’s definitely not the only company in generative AI pursuing the search opportunity: That is essentially how many people are using products like ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing (powered by OpenAI), and Google is making a big push to improve search results with its Gemini LLM.
But Perplexity is building its algorithms incorporating a variety of LLMs, the idea being that this produces a more accurate and richer response.
Now it’s using these to build what it describes as a more advanced enterprise “pro” product, too.
“Unlike other enterprise tools for knowledge work like Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity Enterprise Pro is also the only enterprise AI offering that offers all the cutting-edge foundation models in the market in one single product: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude Opus, Mistral, and more to come,” CEO and co-founder Aravind Srinivas noted earlier today in a tweet promoting the new offering. “This gives customers and users choices to explore and customize their experience depending on their use cases.” That “more to come” may well be including more from Hugging Face and Meta, if Srinivas’s public endorsements and investor lists are anything to go by.
Considering that the company has only been around since 2022, Perplexity’s current investor list is already long, running to 46 names according to PitchBook data.
In addition to IVP and NEA, it includes other notable VCs such as Sequoia, Bessemer and Kindred; strategic backers like Nvidia, Databricks and Bezos Expeditions; and many recognizable individuals such as Jeff Bezos, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, Naval Ravikant, Susan Wojcicki, Elad Gil, Nat Friedman and Clément Delangue from Hugging Face. A newer backer, Daniel Gross, led the $56 million round from March with other new backers Stanley Druckenmiller, Y Combinator head Garry Tan and Figma’s CEO Dylan Field also participating, among others.
One fundraise coming rapidly on the heels of another is reminiscent of rolling fundraising that we’ve seen from other big startups over the years. In the years leading up to its IPO during a time of rapid growth and major attention, Snap regularly appeared to be raising money on an ongoing basis. These days, it appears to be all about AI, with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral all raising at a rapid pace and seeing their valuations skyrocket along with that.
In the case of Perplexity, the startup is standing out in the market for a couple of reasons. Most obviously, it’s one of the ambitious, albeit smaller, hopefuls in the race to build generative AI services. Its unique position in the market is that it’s not focused on the race to build multipurpose large language models. Instead, taking a page from one of the biggest technology companies in the world today, it is tackling one specific product, at least for now: search.
Perplexity is not the only startup in AI that is building on very focused opportunities and by targeting enterprise. Synthesia in the U.K. is taking a similar approach with AI video tools, aiming them specifically at the business market, for the building of training and customer support video content.
In the case of Perplexity, the startup offers its tools on free and enterprise, paid tiers, and so far it has processed 75 million queries this year and is currently on ARR of $20 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its reason for raising again so soon? Yes, perhaps to capitalize on customer and investor interest at what one investor described as a “zeitgeist moment” for the startup. But also because of the mechanics of building any kind of AI service right now.
“Compute is very expensive, so they may need to raise” for that reason alone, one said.
We have reached out to Srinivas for comment and will update this post as we learn more.

我是wall-e，欢迎收听我们的ai简报。美国参议院通过了一项法案，要求字节跳动出售tiktok，否则将面临禁令。这项议案作为外援包裹的一部分，在参议院以79-18的票数通过，此前众议院在周末已经以压倒性多数通过这项议案。美国总统乔·拜登将必须签署这项法案以使其成为法律，据白宫发布的声明，他打算在周三签署。值得注意的是，今年3月，众议院曾通过类似的单独法案，要求禁止tiktok或强制其出售，而且限期为六个月，但参议院并未对那项法案进行表决。因为这次议案与对乌克兰、以色列和台湾的关键外援捆绑在一起，参议院不得不做出决定。tiktok尚未立即发表声明。然而，该公司负责美洲地区公共政策的负责人迈克尔·贝克曼据彭博社表示，公司计划在法院挑战此举。
特斯拉利润下降55%，公司表示，电动汽车销售因混合动力车的压力而“承压”。特斯拉在第一季度的利润同比下降55%，为11.3亿美元。特斯拉表示，在第一季度遭遇了“多项始料未及的挑战”，包括红海冲突、柏林超级工厂的纵火袭击以及其加利福尼亚州弗里蒙特工厂model 3更新款的逐步推进等。特斯拉还指出，全球电动汽车销售持续面临压力，因许多汽车制造商优先考虑混合动力汽车而非电动汽车。不过，这种混合动力汽车的方法意味着汽车制造商继续购买监管信用额度；特斯拉在第一季度从零排放税收抵免中获得了4.42亿美元的收入。
苹果公司宣布，下一次ipad活动将于5月7日举行。苹果刚刚发出了下一次活动的邀请函。预定于5月7日举行的“let loose”（释放）演示似乎将完全在线进行——这在大流行期间成为该公司的标准做法。不过，在过去几年中，苹果已经恢复了面对面的活动，包括将于6月10日在库比蒂诺开始的wwdc。
甲骨文正在将其全球总部迁至纳什维尔。甲骨文公司联合创始人兼董事长拉里·埃里森周二表示，该公司将其全球总部迁至田纳西州纳什维尔，以便更接近一个主要的医疗保健中心。他说，纳什维尔是一个已经确立的医疗中心，是一个“绝佳的居住地”，甲骨文员工对此感到兴奋。
perplexity正在为其ai搜索平台筹集超过2.5亿美元的资金，估值达到了25亿至30亿美元之间。据了解，这家ai搜索引擎初创公司目前正在至少筹集2.5亿美元的资金，估值介于25亿至30亿美元之间。nea和ivp都是公司之前的支持者，据消息人士透露，他们都在考虑参与这一更大的融资轮。

特斯拉正利用第一季度报告关注未来，即利用ai在自主性方面取得进展和推出新产品，包括那些建立在下一代车辆平台上的。该公司在第一季度研发支出11亿美元，同比增长49%。尽管利润下滑，但投资者似乎更关注特斯拉关于未来产品的前瞻性言论，包括到2025年推出多款更便宜的车型的产品路线图更新。
就在今天，感谢大家收听我们的ai简报，我们明天再见。
