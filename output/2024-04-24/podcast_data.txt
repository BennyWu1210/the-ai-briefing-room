 IBM to acquire HashiCorp
IBM CEO Arvind Krishna appears at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 16, 2024.
IBM shares slipped as much as 9% in extended trading Wednesday after the hardware, software and consulting provider said it would acquire cloud software maker HashiCorp and reported first-quarter revenue that was lower than analysts had predicted.
In a statement, IBM announced that it intends to pay $35 per share in cash for HashiCorp in a deal with a $6.4 billion enterprise value, net of cash. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM was getting close to acquiring HashiCorp, sending shares upward. Bloomberg said earlier on Wednesday that IBM was looking to offer $35 per share.
The deal would be accretive to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first full year after close, and accretive to free cash flow in the second year after close. IBM said it expects the transaction to close by the end of 2024. Dave McJannet, HashiCorp's CEO, will report to Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president in charge of software, if the deal goes through, a spokesperson said.
HashiCorp would complement Red Hat, which has contributed to IBM's revenue growth since the $34 billion acquisition in 2019. IBM now sells Red Hat's version of the Linux operating system for use on multiple public clouds, making it a neutral entity.
HashiCorp pioneered open-source software that developers rely on to control cloud infrastructure. Premium versions of the Terraform cloud-management software and other products have brought revenue to HashiCorp.
In 2021 HashiCorp shares started trading on the Nasdaq. But revenue growth has slowed, and the company has continued to report losses. Still, it's adding revenue at a faster pace than IBM.
"We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp," Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. There are short-term cost synergies as well, Kavanaugh said.
The combination should result in more clients wanting to talk to IBM, CEO Arvind Krishna said.
HashiCorp shares moved 4% higher in extended trading following the acquisition announcement.
Here's how IBM did in comparison with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG:
Earnings per share: $1.68 adjusted vs. $1.60 expected
$1.68 adjusted vs. $1.60 expected Revenue: $14.46 billion vs. $14.55 billion expected
IBM's revenue increased around 1.5% year over year during the quarter, according to a statement. This marks the company's third revenue miss in the last five quarters.
Revenue from software, at $5.90 billion, increased about 6% and was below the $5.96 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Red Hat revenue grew 9% during the quarter at constant currency.
IBM's consulting revenue came in at $5.19 billion, down slightly and just under the $5.20 billion StreetAccount consensus.
"We saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tighten discretionary spending," Kavanaugh said.
Infrastructure revenue totaled $3.08 billion. It declined 0.7% but came in higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $2.94 billion.
During the quarter, IBM said it was providing its 160,000 consultants with artificial intelligence assistants to boost productivity, and the company completed the divestiture of The Weather Company to Francisco Partners.
Notwithstanding the after-hours move, IBM shares are up about 13% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which is up 6% over the same period.

TikTok ban signed into law by President Biden: How we got here, and what comes next
TikTok ban signed into law by President Biden: How we got here, and what comes next The TikTok ban has cleared Congress and received White House approval, putting new pressure on Bytedance to divest.
TikTok faces an uncertain fate in the U.S. once again. A bill including a deadline for TikTok parent company Bytedance to divest within nine months or face a ban on app stores to distribute the app in the U.S., was signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday as part of broader legislation including military aid for Israel and Ukraine. The White House’s approval comes swiftly after strong bipartisan approval in the House and a 79-18 Senate vote Tuesday in favor of moving the bill forward.
TikTok is based in Los Angeles and Singapore but is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance. That relationship has raised eyebrows among U.S. officials, who warn that the app could be leveraged to further the interests of an adversary. The bill’s critics argue that the U.S. is unfairly targeting a well-loved social network when the government could be dealing with household issues that directly benefit Americans.
What happened in the Senate?
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has the power to set the chamber’s priorities and round up Democrats for a unified vote, initially said that the Senate “will review the legislation when it comes over from the House.”
The Senate at first seemed far from presenting a united front against TikTok. Some Republican China hawks like Sens. Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn were pushing their chamber of Congress to take up the bill. On the Democratic side, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner issued a joint statement with his Republican committee counterpart, Marco Rubio, in support of a forced sale or ban for TikTok.
“We are united in our concern about the national security threat posed by TikTok — a platform with enormous power to influence and divide Americans whose parent company ByteDance remains legally required to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party,” Warner and Rubio said in an emailed statement. Their Senate committee, which is frequently briefed on national security matters, is particularly relevant given the nature of the concerns expressed by TikTok’s critics in Congress.
Late Tuesday, the Senate approved the $95 billion aid package — including aid for Taiwan and humanitarian aid for Gaza — that also contained the much-debated TikTok ban.
What happened in the House?
In March, the House Energy and Commerce Committee introduced a new bill designed to pressure ByteDance into selling TikTok. The bill marked a fresh push by the U.S. government to separate the company from its Chinese ownership or force it out of the country.
The bill, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, would make it illegal for software with ties to U.S. adversaries to be distributed by U.S. app stores or supported by U.S. web hosts. Within the bill’s definitions, ownership by an entity based in an adversary country, like ByteDance in China, counts.
In language of the bill, which goes on to name TikTok explicitly, “it shall be unlawful for an entity to distribute, maintain, or update (or enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of) a foreign adversary controlled application.” If the bill became law, Apple’s App Store and Google Play could not legally distribute the app in the U.S.
The bill, which many of its detractors reasonably describe as a “ban,” would force ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months for the app to continue operating here. It also empowers the president to have oversight of this process to ensure that it results in the company in question “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.”
After getting wind of the bill’s swift and sudden progress in Congress, TikTok pushed back with a mass in-app message to U.S. users, complete with a button for calling their representatives.
“Speak up now — before your government strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression,” the message read. “Let Congress know what TikTok means to you and tell them to vote NO.”
In spite of TikTok’s decision to rile up its users — or perhaps because of it — the bill to force ByteDance to sell TikTok passed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee with a 50-0 vote. The fast-tracked bill passed a full vote in the House on March 13.
Prior to the vote, subcommittee members had a classified briefing with the FBI, the Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence at the behest of the Biden administration, Punchbowl News reported.
President Biden also explicitly said that he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk. “If they pass it, I’ll sign it,” Biden told a group of reporters. And Biden followed through with that statement in signing the bill Wednesday.
Why does the U.S. say TikTok is a threat?
To be clear, there is currently no public evidence that China has ever tapped into TikTok’s stores of data on Americans or otherwise compromised the app.
Still, that fact hasn’t stopped the U.S. government from highlighting the possibility that China could if it wanted to. The Chinese government hasn’t been shy about going hands-on with companies in the country or keeping critics from its business community in line.
FBI director Chris Wray once cautioned that users might not see “outward signs” if China were ever to meddle with TikTok. “Something that’s very sacred in our country — the difference between the private sector and the public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way the CCP operates,” Wray said in a Senate hearing last year.
TikTok has vehemently denied these accusations. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said last year during a separate hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
To TikTok’s credit, if China wanted to get its hands on information about U.S. users, Beijing could easily turn to data brokers who openly sell troves of user data around the globe with little oversight.
Because the U.S. has not produced any public evidence to back up its serious claims, there’s a major disconnect between how politicians feel about TikTok and how most Americans do. For many TikTok users, the U.S. crackdown is just one more way that politicians are out of touch with young people and don’t understand how they use the internet. For them — and other skeptics of the U.S. government’s claims — the situation looks like pure political posturing between two countries with bad blood, sometimes with a dash of racism.
Where did this idea come from?
The campaign to force ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. company originated with an executive order during the Trump administration. Trump’s threats against the company culminated in a plan to force TikTok to sell its U.S. operations to Oracle in late 2020. In the process, TikTok rejected an acquisition offer from Microsoft but ultimately didn’t sell to Oracle, either, in spite of Trump’s efforts to steer the acquisition to benefit close ally and Republican mega donor Larry Ellison.
The executive action ultimately fizzled in 2021 after Biden took office. But last year, the Biden administration picked up the baton, escalating a pressure campaign against the app along with Congress. Now that campaign looks to be back on track.
Oddly, former President Donald Trump, who himself initiated the idea of a forced TikTok sale four years ago, is no longer in support of a TikTok crackdown. Trump explained his abrupt about-face on TikTok by highlighting the benefit a ban or forced sale could have on Meta, which suspended the former president’s account over his role in inciting violence on January 6.
“Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC. Trump’s tune on TikTok may have changed following a recent meeting with billionaire Republican donor Jeffrey Yass, who owns a 15% stake in TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance.
What’s TikTok’s response to the potential ban?
There is some strong bipartisan congressional support for regulating TikTok, but things are still pretty complex. The most obvious complication: TikTok is enormously popular and we’re in an election year. TikTok has 170 million users in the U.S. and they aren’t likely to quietly watch as Congress effectively bans their favorite source of entertainment and information.
TikTok’s creators and their followers likely won’t go quietly. TikTok accounts with millions of followers have a built-in platform for organizing against the threat to the app that connects them to their communities and facilitates brand deals and advertising income.
TikTok itself would also surely mount a strong legal challenge against the forced sale, much as it did when the Trump administration previously tried to accomplish the same thing through executive action. TikTok also sued when Montana attempted to enact its own ban at the state level, which ultimately resulted in a federal judge issuing an injunction and blocking the effort as unconstitutional.

“This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,” TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression,” Haurek said, foreshadowing the massive public outcry that could result.
The cultural reach of TikTok is so great that Biden is campaigning on TikTok, even as the White House calls the app a national security threat.
Even though the White House has now signed off on the legislation, the U.S. scheme to force ByteDance to sell TikTok could still fail — an outcome that may or may not result in a ban. China has previously stated that it would oppose a forced sale of TikTok, which is well within the Chinese government’s rights following an update to the country’s export rules in late 2020.
Beyond Congress and the courts, TikTok holds a direct line to a massive chunk of the American electorate and a fleet of creators who command many millions of loyal followers. Those levers of power shouldn’t be underestimated in the fight to come.
Still, it’s difficult for TikTok to more effectively organize these millions. Though the X platform, when it operated as Twitter, was highly efficient as a mechanism to share breaking news, TikTok’s algorithms make it less effective as a means of understanding what is happening minute by minute. Though TikTok users say it has become a source of news — among adults, those ages 18 to 29 are most likely to say they receive their news regularly on TikTok — that information tends to be highly targeted and asynchronous. While many users may know something is brewing in Washington, it’s likely they are less aware of the steps required to fight it, making it harder for TikTok to mobilize them.

Nvidia acquires AI workload management startup Run:ai for $700M, sources say
Nvidia is acquiring Run:ai, a Tel Aviv-based company that makes it easier for developers and operations teams to manage and optimize their AI hardware infrastructure. Terms of the deal aren’t being disclosed publicly, but two sources close to the matter tell TechCrunch that the price tag was $700 million.
CTech reported earlier this morning the companies were in “advanced negotiations” that could see Nvidia pay upwards of $1 billion for Run:ai. Evidently, the negotiations went off without a hitch, apart from a possible price change.
Nvidia says that it’ll continue to offer Run:ai’s products “under the same business model” and invest in Run:ai’s product roadmap as part of Nvidia’s DGX Cloud AI platform, which gives enterprise customers access to compute infrastructure and software that they can use to train models for generative and other forms of AI. Nvidia DGX server and workstation and DGX Cloud customers will also gain access to Run:ai’s capabilities for their AI workloads, Nvidia says — particularly for generative AI deployments running across multiple data center locations.
“Run:ai has been a close collaborator with Nvidia since 2020 and we share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,” Omri Geller, Run:ai’s CEO, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to join Nvidia and look forward to continuing our journey together.”
Geller co-founded Run:ai with Ronen Dar several years ago after the two studied together at Tel Aviv University under professor Meir Feder, Run:ai’s third co-founder. Geller, Dar and Feder sought to build a platform that could “break up” AI models into fragments that run in parallel across hardware, whether on-premises, in public clouds or at the edge.
While Run:ai has few direct competitors, other companies are applying the concept of dynamic hardware allocation to AI workloads. For example, Grid.ai offers software that allows data scientists to train AI models across GPUs, processors and more in parallel.
But relatively early in its life, Run:ai managed to establish a large customer base of Fortune 500 companies — which in turn attracted VC investments. Prior to the acquisition, Run:ai had raised $118 million in capital from backers including Insight Partners, Tiger Global, S Capital and TLV Partners.
In the blog post, Alexis Bjorlin, Nvidia’s VP of DGX Cloud, noted that customer AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex and that there’s a growing desire among companies to make more efficient use of their AI computing sources.
A recent survey of organizations adopting AI from ClearML, the machine learning model management company, found that the biggest challenge in scaling AI for 2024 so far has been compute limitations in terms of availability and cost, followed by infrastructure issues.
“Managing and orchestrating generative AI, recommender systems, search engines and other workloads requires sophisticated scheduling to optimize performance at the system level and on the underlying infrastructure,” Bjorlin said. “Nvidia’s accelerated computing platform and Run:ai’s platform will continue to support a broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, giving customers choice and flexibility. Together with Run:ai, Nvidia will enable customers to have a single fabric that accesses GPU solutions anywhere.”
Run:ai is among Nvidia’s biggest acquisitions since its purchase of Mellanox for $6.9 billion in March 2019.

Meta (META) Q1 2024 earnings
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled "Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis," in Dirksen building on Wednesday, January 31, 2024.
Meta shares plunged 16% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company issued a light forecast, which overshadowed better-than-expected first-quarter results.
Here are the key numbers:
Earnings per share : $4.71 per share vs. $4.32 per share expected by LSEG
: $4.71 per share vs. $4.32 per share expected by LSEG Revenue: $36.46 billion vs. $36.16 billion expected by LSEG
Revenue increased 27% from $28.65 billion in the same period a year earlier, the fastest rate of expansion for any quarter since 2021. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion, or $4.71 per share, from $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, a year ago.
One reason for the pop in net income is that, while revenue growth accelerated, sales and marketing costs dropped 16% from the year-earlier period.
Meta said it expects sales in the second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. The midpoint of the range, $37.75 billion, would represent 18% year-over-year growth and is below analysts' average estimate of $38.3 billion.
The stock sell-off accelerated early in the earnings call after CEO Mark Zuckerberg jumped into his discussion about investments, namely in areas like glasses and mixed reality, where the company doesn't currently make money. And he said investments in artificial intelligence are increasing.
"On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively," Zuckerberg said.
The Facebook parent no longer reports daily active users and monthly active users. It now gives a figure for what it calls "family daily active people." That number was 3.24 billion for March 2024, a 7% increase from a year earlier.
Meta has raised investor expectations due to its improved financial performance in recent quarters, leaving little room for error. The stock is up about 40% this year, as of Wednesday's close, after almost tripling last year. In February 2023, Zuckerberg told investors it would be the "year of efficiency," which initiated the rally.
At the time, Zuckerberg said the company would be better at eliminating unnecessary projects and cracking down on bloat, which would help Meta become a "stronger and more nimble organization." The company cut about 21,000 jobs in the first half of 2023, and Zuckerberg said in February of this year that hiring will be "relatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically."
Headcount declined by 10% in the first quarter from a year earlier to 69,329.
Capital expenditures for 2024 are anticipated to be in the $35 billion to $40 billion range, an increase from a prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion "as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap," Meta said.
Average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20, the company said.
Meta has been clawing back digital ad market share after a dismal 2022. At that time, it was reeling from Apple's iOS privacy update and macroeconomic concerns that led many brands to rein in spending.
Zuckerberg spearheaded an initiative to rebuild the ad business with a focus on AI. On the company's last earnings call in February, finance chief Susan Li said Meta has been investing in AI models that can accurately predict relevant ads for users, as well as tools that automate the ads-creation process.
Advertising revenue, which accounts for the vast majority of Meta's business, jumped 27% in the first quarter to $35.64 billion.
Meta is benefiting from a stabilizing economy and surge in spending from Chinese discount retailers like Temu and Shein, which have been pumping money into Facebook and Instagram in an effort to reach a wider swath of users. Some analysts have warned that slower spending from China-based advertisers could be a source of concern in the first quarter and as the year progresses.
Li said on Wednesday's earnings call that the company isn't quantifying the contribution from China in the quarter, but she said advertising revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 41% from a year earlier, making it the fastest growing region, and was boosted by online commerce and gaming.
The company's Reality Labs unit, which houses its hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash. Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the quarter and $3.85 billion in losses, bringing total losses since the end of 2020 to over $45 billion. Analysts expected the division to show an operating loss of $4.31 billion for the quarter.

Stripe, doubling down on embedded finance, de-couples payments from the rest of its stack
Stripe continues to hold the title of being the biggest financial technology business still in private hands, with a current valuation of about $65 billion and a whopping $1 trillion in total processed payment volume last year alone. But fintech is fragmented and a fast-moving target, and with competitors chipping away at its place, Stripe is changing up its approach.
Today, Stripe announced that it will be de-coupling payments — the jewel in its crown — from the rest of its financial services stack. This is a big change, considering that in the past, even as Stripe grew its list of services, it required businesses to be payments customers in order to use any of the rest. Alongside this, the company is adding in a number of new embedded finance features and a new wave of AI tools.
The updates were unveiled at Sessions, Stripe’s big developer event in San Francisco, where the company said it would be announcing more than 50 (yes, 50) new features on its platform, part of a slate of more than 250 (yes, 250) that have been announced so far this year.
That might sound like a lot of noise, but in truth, most of the list of new items is actually on the incremental side — updates and new features to bigger products already announced.
“Our mission is to grow the GDP of the internet. Our strategy is to listen carefully to the needs of the most sophisticated and innovative businesses in the world,” said Patrick Collison, the CEO and co-founder of the company, at the event. “This year, because of our scale, Stripe is well positioned to help our users deal with the increasingly complex payments landscape and put AI to work to drive growth. We’re also making Stripe more modular, so companies can use just the parts of Stripe most useful to them.”
Stripe removing its requirement to use its payments API addresses a major piece of friction for customers and would-be customers who might have wanted to use some of the company’s other tools — which include the likes of fraud, risk and verification services, billing and invoicing, in-person payments, financial account data, and more — but did not want to be all in on Stripe’s larger platform. It signifies a shift in how Stripe views its wider platform: In the past it took the approach that the launch of other services could help lure users to taking its payment services; now it appears to be willing to explore how it can sell some of those other, non-payments services on their own.
In an interview, Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s chief product officer, admitted that users had been asking the company to open up its walled garden for some time, but he claimed that one of the main reasons why it delayed doing so until now was due to it being technically hard to create integrations for legacy services.
On another level, it underscores an interesting shift in the market: Companies like Stripe (and many others like Adyen) have taken a platform approach to the business of payments services. They aim for bigger revenues and margins per customer by becoming one-stop shops. But the truth is that the market is huge and fragmented, and customers of all sizes have dozens, sometimes hundreds, of options for what to use.
Indeed, some will want to have the freedom to be flexible, and some might well be locked into contracts, and some may simply want to work with multiple providers depending on the market in question, or to de-risk by using multiple platforms. That has clearly started to become a bigger opportunity for the company; hence opening up its walled garden now.
Other notable updates announced today
Adding AI tooling to the checkout and fraud tools
Stripe announced a new version of its checkout experience that will be using AI to give a more precise selection of payment options to customers depending on location and what customers may have already used. To fuel the personalization, it’s doubling the number of payment methods to 100. They include the likes of Amazon Pay, Revolut Pay, Swish, Twint, and Zip.
“What we’ve heard historically is, hey, we need more payment method coverage if you want us to go all in on Stripe,” Gaybrick said. OpenAI (which is also one of Stripe’s AI partners), Slack and River Island are among Stripe’s customers for this service.
Stripe said that developers will also be seeing more AI when it runs A/B testing on the checkout flow.
On the fraud front, this is one area where Stripe is very much following the market trends, where we are seeing AI tooling being added into a number of fraud detection services. In its case, it’s launching a new tool called “Radar Assistant,” which lets users create new fraud tools on its Radar risk platform using natural language commands.
Big embedded finance feature update
Embedded finance — which involves companies, which may or may not be focusing on financial services, integrating financial products into their apps and other services to improve customer loyalty, revenues and experience — has become a growing area in fintech, with companies like Rapyd, Plaid, Airwallex and TrueLayer among the dozens of companies building and provisioning these tools to neobanks, other fintechs and others. Given that many “as a service” offerings also offer payments, it’s important that Stripe continue to build out its own embedded finance efforts, branded Stripe Connect, to remain competitive.
Today it announced a number of upgrades to bring the total number of Connect tools to 17, including 10 focused on different payments services. These include, for example, adding in Stripe Capital to offer loans to customers, it said. Gaybrick told TechCrunch that Lightspeed, the point-of-sale company, makes 50% of its revenues now from embedded finance products, so it’s an important area for Stripe to keep developing.
Usage-based billing upgrade
Stripe has, frankly speaking, been somewhat slow on building out more sophisticated subscription and billing products, opening the door for companies like Paddle and more recent arrivals like Lago (which focuses on open sourced billing) to create significantly more nuanced offerings to address the wave of new technology and pricing for that tech in the market. These range not just to more granular and customizable subscription models, but also the introduction of usage-based billing, based on whatever parameters that customers want to create. Now Stripe is also throwing its hat into that game. Anthropic is a high-profile customer using various billing tools from Stripe to tailor how it charges and bills for its API. However it’s not (yet) adopting usage-based billing, the company said.
“For Claude Pro, we use Stripe Billing to manage subscriptions. For our API, we use Stripe Invoicing to make it easy to automate accounts receivable, collect payments, and reconcile transactions. This improves the experience for Anthropic and our customers alike,” said Daniela Amodei, co-founder and president of Anthropic, in a statement.
Updated to clarify that Anthropic is not yet using Stripe’s usage-based billing feature.

in legislative developments, a tiktok ban has officially been signed into law by president biden amidst bipartisan concerns over national security linked to its chinese parent company, bytedance. this marks a pivotal moment for the future of tiktok in the u.s., prompting a potential divestment within nine months to avoid a comprehensive app store ban. the move has sparked widespread debate over the balance between security and free expression online.

switching gears to acquisitions, nvidia is stepping up its ai game with a $700 million purchase of run:ai, a company specializing in ai workload management. this strategic move aims to bolster nvidia's ai platform capabilities, specifically catering to the complex demands of generative ai deployments across various data center locations.

meta, formerly known as facebook, reported a significant plunge of 16% in extended trading following a forecast that failed to meet expectations, despite beating first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates. ceo mark zuckerberg's focus on long-term investments in ai, glasses, and mixed reality prompts questions about their current revenue-generation capabilities amidst soaring expectations for meta's financial performance.

lastly, stripe is making waves by decoupling its flagship payments service from the rest of its financial services stack. this monumental shift allows businesses to tap into stripe's versatile suite of services without being tethered to its payments api, a move that signifies stripe's adaptive response to the diversified demands of today's fintech landscape.

i'm wall-e, and this is your tech briefing. big news from ibm as it aims to strengthen its cloud arsenal by acquiring cloud software powerhouse hashicorp for an astonishing $6.4 billion. shares of ibm took a dive, down by 9% in after-hours trading, underscoring the hefty price tag of this expansion. this move is a key part of ibm's strategy, serving as a complement to its 2019 acquisition of red hat, and signals a major push into cloud infrastructure management. despite falling short on revenue this quarter, ibm's bold step emphasizes its commitment to fortifying its cloud and software services.

turning to legislative matters, president biden has just signed into law a ban on tiktok, amidst strong bipartisan concerns over the national security implications of its chinese parent company, bytedance. this critical development could force tiktok to sever ties within nine months to steer clear of an outright app store ban. the legislation has ignited a fierce debate on the tightrope walk between ensuring national security and preserving freedom of expression online.

in other acquisition news, nvidia is ramping up its presence in the ai space with a strategic $700 million acquisition of run:ai, specialists in ai workload management. this move is poised to enhance nvidia's ai platform capabilities, especially in managing the intricate demands of generative ai across various data center environments.

meta, previously known as facebook, has experienced a significant downturn, with shares plunging 16% in extended trading. this comes as the company's outlook falls short of wall street forecasts, despite outperforming first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. ceo mark zuckerberg's heavy investment in ai, glasses, and mixed reality technologies raises important questions about their immediate revenue potential amidst soaring financial performance expectations.

lastly, stripe is making headlines by separating its flagship payments service from its broader financial services offerings. this significant change allows businesses more flexibility to integrate stripe's comprehensive suite of services without being bound to its payments api. a strategic response to the evolving demands of the fintech ecosystem, this move positions stripe to better cater to a diverse range of financial operations.

我是 wall-e，欢迎来到ai简报。ibm正寻求以每股35美元的现金价格收购hashicorp，并将此次交易的企业价值定为64亿美元，净现金计算在内。ibm本周三在盘后交易中宣布此消息后，其股价一度下跌9%，这是因为该硬件、软件及咨询服务提供商公布的第一季度收入低于分析师预期。ibm表示，该交易预计将在2024年底前完成。此外，ibm发布了与分析师共识相比较的收益情况。

同时，总统拜登签署了禁止tiktok的法案，这给字节跳动带来了新的压力，要求其在九个月内进行剥离。此举再次让tiktok在美国的命运变得不确定。该法案作为一项更广泛的立法的一部分获得了白宫的批准，该立法包括对以色列和乌克兰的军事援助。

nvidia将以7亿美元的价格收购位于特拉维夫的人工智能工作负载管理创业公司run:ai。nvidia表示，将继续以相同的商业模式提供run:ai的产品，并将投资于run:ai的产品路线图，作为nvidia的dgx cloud ai平台的一部分。

meta在第一季度财报中发布了超出预期的良好结果，但其发布的展望较轻，导致股价在盘后交易中下跌了16%。meta公布的业绩如下：每股收益4.71美元，预期为4.32美元；收入364.6亿美元，预期为361.6亿美元。尽管财务业绩有所改善，但meta表示计划在2024年的资本支出将位于350亿至400亿美元之间，高于此前的预测。

stripe宣布将其支付服务与其他金融服务栈分离，并新增了一系列嵌入式金融功能和一批新的ai工具。stripe在其大型开发者活动上宣布了这一消息，并表示今年将发布超过250项新功能。此举展示了stripe视其更广泛平台的新态度：向市场开放，而不再是全面要求客户采用其支付服务。
