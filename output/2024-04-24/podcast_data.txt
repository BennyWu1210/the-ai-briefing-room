 Biden signs bill that would ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to sell the app
President Biden has signed a bill that would ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, fails to sell it within a year. The bill, which includes aid for Ukraine and Israel, was passed by the U.S. Senate in a 79-18 vote late Tuesday after the House passed it with overwhelming majority over the weekend.
The bill gives ByteDance nine months to divest TikTok, with a 90-day extension available to complete a deal. If ByteDance doesn’t sell TikTok, it would become illegal for app stores to distribute the app in the U.S.
In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, TikTok said it would challenge the “unconstitutional law” in court.
“We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,” the statement reads. “The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate 7 million businesses and silence 170 million Americans. As we continue to challenge this unconstitutional ban, we will continue investing and innovating to ensure TikTok remains a space where Americans of all walks of life can safely come to share their experiences, find joy, and be inspired.”
TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew shared his own video response on Wednesday, calling the news “a disappointing moment” and stating that TikTok “will keep fighting.”
Back in March, the House passed a similar standalone bill to ban TikTok or force its sale within six-months time, but the Senate never took that bill up. This time, the House packaged the TikTok bill with foreign aid to U.S. allies, which essentially forced the Senate to make a decision.
TikTok has spent the last few months arguing that its platform is essential for creators and small businesses in the United States. A few weeks ago, the company released an economic impact report revealing that TikTok generated $14.7 billion for small to mid-sized companies in the U.S.
The ban would not be a first for TikTok. Four years ago, India banned the app following a military battle along the India-China border, and both Google and Meta quickly seized the opportunity to capture both local creators and TikTok users via their respective copycat products, YouTube Shorts and Instagram’s Reels.
Numerous other countries also banned the service, including Senegal, Nepal, Afghanistan, Somalia and Iran.

IBM to acquire HashiCorp
IBM CEO Arvind Krishna appears at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 16, 2024.
IBM shares slipped as much as 9% in extended trading Wednesday after the hardware, software and consulting provider said it would acquire cloud software maker HashiCorp and reported first-quarter revenue that was lower than analysts had predicted.
In a statement, IBM announced that it intends to pay $35 per share in cash for HashiCorp in a deal with a $6.4 billion enterprise value, net of cash. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM was getting close to acquiring HashiCorp, sending shares upward. Bloomberg said earlier on Wednesday that IBM was looking to offer $35 per share.
The deal would be accretive to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first full year after close, and accretive to free cash flow in the second year after close. IBM said it expects the transaction to close by the end of 2024. Dave McJannet, HashiCorp's CEO, will report to Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president in charge of software, if the deal goes through, a spokesperson said.
HashiCorp would complement Red Hat, which has contributed to IBM's revenue growth since the $34 billion acquisition in 2019. IBM now sells Red Hat's version of the Linux operating system for use on multiple public clouds, making it a neutral entity.
HashiCorp pioneered open-source software that developers rely on to control cloud infrastructure. Premium versions of the Terraform cloud-management software and other products have brought revenue to HashiCorp.
In 2021 HashiCorp shares started trading on the Nasdaq. But revenue growth has slowed, and the company has continued to report losses. Still, it's adding revenue at a faster pace than IBM.
"We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp," Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. There are short-term cost synergies as well, Kavanaugh said.
The combination should result in more clients wanting to talk to IBM, CEO Arvind Krishna said.
HashiCorp shares moved 4% higher in extended trading following the acquisition announcement.
Here's how IBM did in comparison with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG:
Earnings per share: $1.68 adjusted vs. $1.60 expected
$1.68 adjusted vs. $1.60 expected Revenue: $14.46 billion vs. $14.55 billion expected
IBM's revenue increased around 1.5% year over year during the quarter, according to a statement. This marks the company's third revenue miss in the last five quarters.
Revenue from software, at $5.90 billion, increased about 6% and was below the $5.96 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Red Hat revenue grew 9% during the quarter at constant currency.
IBM's consulting revenue came in at $5.19 billion, down slightly and just under the $5.20 billion StreetAccount consensus.
"We saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tighten discretionary spending," Kavanaugh said.
Infrastructure revenue totaled $3.08 billion. It declined 0.7% but came in higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $2.94 billion.
During the quarter, IBM said it was providing its 160,000 consultants with artificial intelligence assistants to boost productivity, and the company completed the divestiture of The Weather Company to Francisco Partners.
Notwithstanding the after-hours move, IBM shares are up about 13% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which is up 6% over the same period.

Nvidia acquires AI workload management startup Run:ai for $700M, sources say
Nvidia is acquiring Run:ai, a Tel Aviv-based company that makes it easier for developers and operations teams to manage and optimize their AI hardware infrastructure. Terms of the deal aren’t being disclosed publicly, but two sources close to the matter tell TechCrunch that the price tag was $700 million.
CTech reported earlier this morning the companies were in “advanced negotiations” that could see Nvidia pay upwards of $1 billion for Run:ai. Evidently, the negotiations went off without a hitch, apart from a possible price change.
Nvidia says that it’ll continue to offer Run:ai’s products “under the same business model” and invest in Run:ai’s product roadmap as part of Nvidia’s DGX Cloud AI platform, which gives enterprise customers access to compute infrastructure and software that they can use to train models for generative and other forms of AI. Nvidia DGX server and workstation and DGX Cloud customers will also gain access to Run:ai’s capabilities for their AI workloads, Nvidia says — particularly for generative AI deployments running across multiple data center locations.
“Run:ai has been a close collaborator with Nvidia since 2020 and we share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,” Omri Geller, Run:ai’s CEO, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to join Nvidia and look forward to continuing our journey together.”
Geller co-founded Run:ai with Ronen Dar several years ago after the two studied together at Tel Aviv University under professor Meir Feder, Run:ai’s third co-founder. Geller, Dar and Feder sought to build a platform that could “break up” AI models into fragments that run in parallel across hardware, whether on-premises, in public clouds or at the edge.
While Run:ai has few direct competitors, other companies are applying the concept of dynamic hardware allocation to AI workloads. For example, Grid.ai offers software that allows data scientists to train AI models across GPUs, processors and more in parallel.
But relatively early in its life, Run:ai managed to establish a large customer base of Fortune 500 companies — which in turn attracted VC investments. Prior to the acquisition, Run:ai had raised $118 million in capital from backers including Insight Partners, Tiger Global, S Capital and TLV Partners.
In the blog post, Alexis Bjorlin, Nvidia’s VP of DGX Cloud, noted that customer AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex and that there’s a growing desire among companies to make more efficient use of their AI computing sources.
A recent survey of organizations adopting AI from ClearML, the machine learning model management company, found that the biggest challenge in scaling AI for 2024 so far has been compute limitations in terms of availability and cost, followed by infrastructure issues.
“Managing and orchestrating generative AI, recommender systems, search engines and other workloads requires sophisticated scheduling to optimize performance at the system level and on the underlying infrastructure,” Bjorlin said. “Nvidia’s accelerated computing platform and Run:ai’s platform will continue to support a broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, giving customers choice and flexibility. Together with Run:ai, Nvidia will enable customers to have a single fabric that accesses GPU solutions anywhere.”
Run:ai is among Nvidia’s biggest acquisitions since its purchase of Mellanox for $6.9 billion in March 2019.

Meta loses $200 billion in value, Zuckerberg focuses on AI, metaverse
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC.
Mark Zuckerberg started Meta 's earnings call by talking about artificial intelligence. Then he moved onto the metaverse, touting his company's headsets, glasses and operating system. He spent almost the entirety of his opening remarks focused on the many ways Meta loses money.
Investors weren't into it. Meta shares tumbled as much as 19% in extended trading on Wednesday, wiping out more than $200 billion in market cap. The drop came despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.
Zuckerberg appeared ready for the sell-off.
"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it," Zuckerberg said. He cited past efforts like short-video service Reels, Stories and the transition to mobile.
Meta generates 98% of its revenue from digital advertising. But to the extent Zuckerberg talked about ads, he was looking to the future and the ways the company could potentially turn its current investments into ad dollars. In discussing Meta's effort to build a "leading AI," Zuckerberg said, "There are several ways to build a massive business here including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions."
He spent more time talking about Meta Llama 3, the company's newest large language model, and the recent rollout of Meta AI, the company's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Zuckerberg then moved onto potential opportunities for expansion within the mixed-reality headset market, like a headset for work or fitness. Meta opened up access to the operating system that powers its Quest headsets on Monday, which Zuckerberg said will help the mixed-reality ecosystem grow faster.
He also talked up Meta's AR glasses, which he called "the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear."

Tesla surges after Elon Musk says new affordable EV models coming
Tesla shares closed up 12% on Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk said the electric-vehicle company plans to begin production of new affordable EV models by early 2025.
Musk's comments came during Tesla's earnings call on Tuesday after the company reported disappointing first-quarter numbers. Revenue fell 9% year over year, its steepest annual decline since 2012.
The company previously expected to start production of the new EV models in the second half of 2025. Tesla has not disclosed any details about affordable new models in the works. Typically, the company promotes design concepts years ahead of production in "unveiling" events.
Tesla reported 45 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $21.3 billion in revenue, falling short of the 51 cents in expected earnings per share and $22.15 billion in expected sales, per LSEG.
Revenue dropped from $23.3 billion a year before and from $25.17 billion in the previous quarter.
Analysts of Bank of America said in an investor note Wednesday that Tesla's first-quarter results and leadership's commentary "addressed key concerns" and "revitalized the growth narrative," prompting them to upgrade the stock from neutral to buy while maintaining their $220 price target.

i'm wall-e, and this is your ai briefing for today. 

in a significant development, president biden has signed a bill that could spell the end for tiktok in the u.s. unless its parent company, bytedance, finds a buyer within the year. this decision follows a substantial senate vote and highlights growing concerns over data privacy and national security. tiktok has vowed to fight back, claiming it has already taken significant steps to protect user data on its platform. the move echoes similar actions taken by india and a handful of other countries in recent years, each citing their own reasons for sidelining the popular app.

meanwhile, in the corporate sphere, ibm has announced a pending acquisition of cloud software company hashicorp for $35 per share, translating to a total enterprise value of $6.4 billion. this strategic move aims at bolstering ibm’s already robust cloud services, following the successful integration of red hat. however, news of the acquisition comes alongside a reported dip in ibm's first-quarter revenue, sending shares tumbling in extended trading.

not to be outdone, nvidia is expanding its ai prowess with the purchase of run:ai, a startup focusing on ai workload management, for a reported $700 million. this acquisition, poised to enhance nvidia’s dgx cloud ai platform, underscores the tech giant's commitment to leading the charge in ai infrastructure optimization across various industries.

in other news, meta’s valuation took a steep $200 billion dive as ceo mark zuckerberg's focus on ai and the metaverse failed to enthuse investors. despite meta posting better-than-expected profit and revenue for q1, the company’s heavy investment in unproven markets has led to skepticism about its future profitability and growth trajectory.

on a brighter note, tesla's stock surged by 12% following ceo elon musk's announcement of new, more affordable ev models set to begin production by early 2025. this news comes as a revitalizing boost after the electric-vehicle maker reported its steepest yearly revenue decline since 2012, underscoring the challenges and competition it faces in the automotive market.

big news out of washington as president biden has inked a bill potentially marking the end of tiktok's presence in the u.s. the clock is ticking for its parent company, bytedance, to find a buyer within a year. this decision, underscored by a considerable senate vote, heightens the focus on data privacy and national security issues. in retaliation, tiktok is mounting a defense, asserting its efforts in safeguarding user data on its platform. this move mirrors steps taken by india and other nations, each with their motives for pushing aside the popular app.

switching gears to the corporate landscape, ibm has announced its plans to acquire cloud software firm hashicorp at $35 per share, totaling a valuation of $6.4 billion. this acquisition is poised to enhance ibm’s cloud service offerings, building on the successful integration of red hat. however, ibm revealed a dip in first-quarter revenue alongside this announcement, which saw its shares decline in after-hours trading.

not to be left behind, nvidia has declared its intentions to elevate its ai capabilities with the acquisition of run:ai, a startup specializing in ai workload management, tagged at $700 million. this strategic move aims to boost nvidia's dgx cloud ai platform, showcasing the tech titan's dedication to pioneering ai infrastructure optimization across a spectrum of industries.

in other developments, meta faces a challenging period as its valuation plummeted by $200 billion following ceo mark zuckerberg's push towards ai and the metaverse, a move that left investors unenthused. despite posting profits and revenue that exceeded expectations for q1, meta’s substantial investments in speculative markets have cast doubts over its future profitability and growth prospects.

on a more positive note, tesla's shares ascended by 12% after ceo elon musk announced the forthcoming production of new, more affordable ev models slated for early 2025. this announcement comes as a welcome uplift after the company reported its steepest annual revenue downturn since 2012, highlighting the intensified competition and obstacles within the automotive sector.

我是wall-e，欢迎来到您的ai简报。拜登总统签署了一项法案，如果字节跳动公司未能在一年内出售tiktok，该法案将禁止tiktok。该法案包括对乌克兰和以色列的援助，周二晚些时候以79-18票通过了美国参议院审议，此前该法案已在周末获得众议院压倒性多数通过。该法案赋予字节跳动公司九个月时间出售tiktok，有一次90天的延期机会来完成交易。如果字节跳动公司未能出售tiktok，应用商店将被禁止在美国分发该应用。tiktok在一份发给techcrunch的电子邮件声明中表示，它将对这一“违宪法律”提起诉讼。

ibm宣布以每股35美元现金的价格收购云软件制造商hashicorp，交易的企业价值净额为64亿美元。ibm表示，这项交易预计将在收购完成后的第一个完整年度增加调整后的息税折旧摊销前利润，并在收购完成后的第二年增加自由现金流。ibm预计这项交易将在2024年底前完成。

nvidia正以7亿美元的价格收购位于特拉维夫的公司run:ai，后者简化了开发人员和运营团队管理和优化其ai硬件基础设施的能力。nvidia表示，将继续以“相同的商业模式”提供run:ai的产品，并在nvidia的dgx cloud ai平台中投资run:ai的产品路线图，该平台为企业客户提供了可以用于训练生成式和其他形式ai的计算基础设施和软件。

meta在周三的盘后交易中暴跌，市值蒸发超过2000亿美元，尽管meta报告的第一季度利润和收入好于预期。扎克伯格开始讲述人工智能，然后转移到元宇宙，推崇他的公司的头戴设备、眼镜和操作系统。他几乎把开场白的全部时间都集中在meta亏损的多种方式上。

tesla在周三收盘时上涨了12%，此前ceo埃隆·马斯克表示，这家电动汽车公司计划在2025年初开始生产新的经济型电动汽车车型。马斯克的评论发表在tesla周二公布令人失望的第一季度财报后的财报电话会议上。营收同比下降9%，这是自2012年以来最大的年度降幅。
