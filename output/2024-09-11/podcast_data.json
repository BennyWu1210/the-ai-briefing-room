Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday September 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI reportedly in talks to raise at $150B valuation\ndescription0:\nOpenAI is reportedly in talks with investors to raise $6.5 billion at a $150 billion pre-money valuation, according to Bloomberg.\nThe new valuation is significantly higher than OpenAI\u2019s previously reported valuation from earlier this year, $86 billion, and far higher than any other AI startup today. The funding round will reportedly be led by Thrive Capital, a major investor of OpenAI in previous rounds. Other reported investors include Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia \u2014 OpenAI partners that are all invested in the success of the AI startup, in one way or another.\nBloomberg also reports that OpenAI is in talks to raise $5 billion in debt from a few banks.\nIn August, the Wall Street Journal reported Thrive was leading a massive funding round for OpenAI, planning to contribute roughly $1 billion. However, the Journal reported OpenAI\u2019s valuation for this round at around $100 billion.\n\ntitle1:\nMark Zuckerberg says he's done apologizing\ndescription1:\nThe home of the Golden State Warriors was packed on Tuesday evening this week, but it wasn\u2019t to watch Steph Curry. Thousands of fans gathered at the Chase Center in downtown San Francisco to watch one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest ballers, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sit down for a conversation with the hosts of the Acquired podcast, David Rosenthal and Ben Gilbert.\nShortly after hopping onstage, Zuckerberg joked that he might need to schedule his next appearance in order to apologize for whatever he was about to say. After a beat, he added that he was just kidding and that, in fact, his days of apologizing are over.\nZuckerberg has had something of a rebrand recently. He raises cattle in Hawaii now, has long bouncy curls and a gold chain, and commissions Roman-style statues of his wife. Onstage, the Facebook founder wore a boxy T-shirt he designed himself alongside fashion designer Mike Amiri that read \u201clearning through suffering\u201d in Greek letters.\nZuck onstage at the Chase Center wearing a shirt he designed with Mike Amiri. Image Credits: Maxwell Zeff\nThe tongue-in-cheek comment about apologizing was a reference to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who himself addressed a flub he\u2019d made on the Acquired podcast earlier this year, via a pre-recorded video on a screen hanging over the crowd. Huang\u2019s original comment \u2014 that he never would have started Nvidia if he knew what he did today \u2014 was grossly taken out of context, he said. In the video, he clarified that he absolutely would start Nvidia again, and that his comment was more about the blissful ignorance of startup founders.\nWhile Zuckerberg\u2019s opening comment was just a friendly jab at Huang, it set the tone for Zuckerberg\u2019s new attitude toward life and business. The founder of Facebook has spent a lot of time apologizing for Facebook\u2019s content moderation issues. But when reflecting on the biggest mistakes of his career, Zuckerberg said his largest one was a \u201cpolitical miscalculation\u201d that he described as a \u201c20-year mistake.\u201d Specifically, he said, he\u2019d taken too much ownership for problems allegedly out of Facebook\u2019s control.\n\u201cSome of the things they were asserting that we were doing or were responsible for, I don\u2019t actually think we were,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a political problem\u2026 there are people operating in good faith who are identifying a problem and want something to be fixed, and there are people who are just looking for someone to blame.\u201d\nThe vague comments seemed to be about critics blaming Facebook for its part in Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016. Among other things, a firm called Cambridge Analytica took Facebook users\u2019 data and attempted to use it to influence voters to choose Trump. Foreign actors also used the platform in an attempt to influence the election and sow political division, culminating in years of bad press for the company and in Zuckerberg testifying before Congress. (It\u2019s unclear how effective these campaigns actually were.) In the months following the 2016 election, Zuckerberg lamented how almost no one had good things to say about Facebook.\nNow, however, Zuckerberg says he\u2019s found the right balance on political issues. He didn\u2019t say much more than that, but his recent actions are instructive.\nIn August, the Meta CEO sent a letter to House Republicans effectively apologizing for censoring misinformation around COVID-19 in 2020, and bending to demands from the Biden administration. Zuckerberg said he regrets not being more outspoken about the pressure from government officials at the time. In the future, Zuckerberg said he would \u201cpush back if something like this happens again.\u201d\nMeanwhile on Meta\u2019s platforms, Facebook and Instagram have removed all special restrictions for Trump\u2019s social media accounts. These restrictions were originally placed on his accounts after the January 6 insurrection in 2021, but will not impact Trump\u2019s accounts going into the 2024 election.\nIn July, while not going as far as to endorse a specific candidate for U.S. president, the Meta CEO also called Trump a \u201cbadass\u201d for lifting his fist in the air after someone attempted to assassinate him.\nOn Tuesday night, Zuckerberg said he\u2019s more excited about projects outside of social media these days, describing Meta as a \u201chuman connection\u201d company at its core. The Meta CEO noted how no one gets out of bed in the morning and goes \u201cf\u2014 yea, social media!\u201d Instead, he wants to make more \u201cawesome\u201d products, seemingly referring to Meta\u2019s AR glasses, VR goggles, and open source AI efforts.\nZuckerberg was pressed at one point about whether he regrets naming the company Meta, which signaled the company\u2019s pivot toward the metaverse. The CEO simply replied, \u201cMeta is a good name.\u201d\nRegardless of where Zuckerberg\u2019s focus is, Meta\u2019s social media platforms are still where billions of people convene every day. That means content moderation issues will arise, and the CEO will ultimately have to make consequential decisions.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon starts testing ads in its Rufus chatbot\ndescription2:\nRufus, Amazon\u2019s recently launched, shopping-focused chatbot, is getting ads soon.\nThat\u2019s according to a changelog published by Amazon this week (first spotted by AdWeek), which states that sponsored ads could soon start appearing in placements for Rufus users in the U.S. Ads will be shown based on Amazon search and conversational context, Amazon says, and Rufus may generate text to accompany existing ad copy in certain cases.\nImage Credits: Amazon\n\u201cWe continue to make enhancements to the Rufus experience, including improving brand and product discovery by introducing relevant sponsored ads that help customers discover selections related to their conversation with Rufus,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThe ads in Rufus test recalls Microsoft\u2019s experiments inserting ads into Copilot, the chatbot in Bing and the company\u2019s other properties, including Windows. AI being the costly endeavor that it is, it\u2019s not exactly surprising that companies are looking for tried-and-true methods to generate a return on investment \u2014 or at least break even.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle's AI note-taking app NotebookLM can now explain complex topics to you out loud\ndescription3:\nGoogle announced on Wednesday that its AI note-taking and research app, NotebookLM, is adding an \u201cAudio Overview\u201d feature. Audio Overview will give users another way to digest and comprehend the information in the documents they have uploaded to the app, such as course readings or legal briefs.\nSince its launch, NotebookLM has used text to summarize and explain source materials, but now, it can do so out loud using audio. The feature is geared toward people who grasp materials better by listening to explanations as opposed to reading them.\nAI-generated virtual hosts will use conversational speech patterns to give you a summary of the materials you have shared. The hosts will share facts or compelling topics from the source material and do things like use metaphors to explain complicated concepts. Google says that listening to these discussions will help users find new connections between their documents or get inspiration for their drafts.\nTo get started with Audio Overview, you need to open an existing notebook, navigate to the Notebook guide, and click on the \u201cgenerate\u201d button on the right-hand side. It can take up to five minutes for an audio conversation to generate, and for now, you can only generate conversations in English.\nYou also have the option to download the conversation and listen to it on the go to get a quick understanding of your source materials.\nAudio conversations are still in beta and there may be some inaccuracies in the conversations, Google says.\nThe company first demoed NotebookLM under the name Project Tailwind back in June 2023 at Google I/O before making it available to everyone above the age of 18 in the U.S. last December. The app is now available in over 200 countries in more than 108 languages.\n\ntitle4:\nAdobe says video generation is coming to Firefly this year\ndescription4:\nUsers will get their first chance to try Adobe\u2019s AI model for video generation in just a couple months. The company says features powered by Adobe\u2019s Firefly Video model will become available before the end of 2024 on the Premiere Pro beta app and on a free website.\nAdobe says three features \u2014 Generative Extend, Text to Video, and Image to Video \u2014 are currently in a private beta, but will be public soon.\nGenerative Extend, which lets you extend any input video by two seconds, will be embedded into the Premiere Pro beta app later this year. Firefly\u2019s Text to Video and Image to Video models, which create five-second videos from prompts or input images, will be available on Firefly\u2019s dedicated website later this year as well. (The time limit may increase, Adobe noted.)\nPrompt: Cinematic closeup and detailed portrait of a reindeer in a snowy forest at sunset. The lighting is cinematic and gorgeous and soft and sun-kissed, with golden backlight and dreamy bokeh and lens flares\nAdobe\u2019s software has been a favorite among creatives for decades, but generative AI tools like these may upend the very industry the company serves, for better or worse. Firefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to the recent wave of generative AI models, including OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Runway\u2019s Gen-3 Alpha. The tools have captivated audiences, making clips in minutes that would have taken hours for a human to create. However, these early attempts at tools are generally considered too unpredictable to use in professional settings.\nBut controllability is where Adobe thinks it can set itself apart. Adobe\u2019s CTO of digital media, Ely Greenfield, tells TechCrunch there is a \u201chuge appetite\u201d for Firefly\u2019s AI tools where they can complement or accelerate existing workflows.\nFor instance, Greenfield says Firefly\u2019s generative fill feature, added to Adobe Photoshop last year, is \u201cone of the most frequently used features we\u2019ve introduced in the past decade.\u201d\nAdobe would not disclose the price of these AI video features. For other Firefly tools, Adobe allots Creative Cloud customers a certain number of \u201cgenerative credits,\u201d where one credit typically yields one generation result. More expensive plans, obviously, provide more credits.\nIn a demo with TechCrunch, Greenfield showcased the Firefly-powered features coming later this year.\nGenerative Extend can pick up where the original video stops, adding an extra two seconds of footage in a relatively seamless way. The feature takes the last few frames in a scene, running them through Firefly\u2019s Video model to predict the next couple seconds. For the scene\u2019s audio, Generative Extend will recreate background noise, such as traffic or the sounds of nature, but not people\u2019s voices or music. Greenfield says that\u2019s to comply with licensing requirements from the music industry.\nGenerative Extend was used on this clip right around the :08 second mark, just after the lens flare.\nIn one example, Greenfield showed a video clip of an astronaut looking out into space that had been modified with the feature. I was able to tell the moment it had been extended, just after an unusual lens flare appeared on screen, but the camera pan and objects in the scene stayed consistent. I could see it being useful when your scene ends a moment too soon, and you need to draw it out just a bit longer to transition or fade out.\nFirefly\u2019s Text to Video and Image to Video feature are more familiar. They allow you to input a text or image prompt and get up to five seconds of video out. Users will be able to access these AI video generators on firefly.adobe.com, likely with rate limits (though Adobe did not specify).\nAdobe also says Firefly\u2019s Text to Video features are quite good at spelling words correctly, something AI video models tend to struggle with.\nPrompt: Macro detailed shot of water splashing and freezing to spell the word ICE\nIn terms of safeguards, Adobe is erring on the side of caution to start out. Greenfield says Firefly\u2019s video models have blocks around generating videos including nudity, drugs, and alcohol. Further, he added, Adobe\u2019s video generation models are not trained on public figures, like politicians and celebrities. The same certainly can\u2019t be said for some of the competition.\"\n\nResponse:",
