Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday June 28), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nHebbia raises nearly $100M Series B for AI-powered document search led by Andreessen Horowitz\ndescription0:\nHebbia, a startup using generative AI to search large documents and return answers, has raised a nearly $100 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe round valued the company between $700 \u2013 $800 million, although TechCrunch couldn\u2019t verify whether that valuation is pre- or post-money. (One possible scenario is $700 million pre/$800 million post.) Hebbia disclosed in an SEC filing in May that it had by then raised $93 million out of a hoped-for $100 million, but we understand from two of the people that the round hit a near $100 million mark and has closed.\nHebbia and Andreessen Horowitz didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nHebbia was founded in 2020 by George Sivulka, who launched the company while working on his PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford. Sivulka was inspired by his friends working in the financial industry who told him that part of their long work weeks was spent searching for information in SEC filings and other dense documents. Sivulka thought that AI could help them save hours at the office and give them more time for rest and sleep.\nHebbia\u2019s AI can look over billions of documents at once, including PDFs, PowerPoints, spreadsheets and transcripts and return specific answers, the company says.\nThe startup sells primarily to financial service firms, including hedge funds and investment banks. But its product could also be used by law firms and other professional domains.\nThe latest funding brings Hebbia\u2019s total capital to over $120 million. The company raised its $30 million Series A in September 2022 led by Index Ventures with participation from Radical Ventures.\nThe company\u2019s product is similar to Glean, whose software can fetch information in plain English from various business applications. In February, Glean raised a $200 million Series D at a valuation of $2.2 billion, led by Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta starts testing user-created AI chatbots on Instagram\ndescription1:\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Thursday that the company will begin to surface AI characters made by creators through Meta AI studio on Instagram. The tests will begin in the U.S.\nThe social media company\u2019s announcement comes on the same day as a16z-backed chatbot company Character.AI is rolling out the ability for users to talk with AI avatars over a call.\nIn a post on his broadcast channel, Zuckerberg noted that these chatbots will be clearly marked as AI so users are aware.\n\u201cRolling out an early test in the U.S. of our AI studio so you might start seeing AIs from your favorite creators and interest-based AIs in the coming weeks on Instagram. These will primarily show up in messaging for now, and will be clearly labeled as AI,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s early days and the first beta version of these AIs, so we\u2019ll keep working on improving them and make them available to more people soon,\u201d Zuckerberg added.\nZuckerberg noted that it worked with creators like the meme account Wasted and technology creator Don Allen Stevenson III to roll out early versions of creator-made chatbots.\nIn an interview Zuckerberg shared on his social channels, the CEO expanded on the use cases for AI avatars, saying, \u201cThere needs to be a lot of different APIs that get created to reflect people\u2019s different interests. So a big part of the approach is going to be enabling every creator, and then eventually also every small business on the platform, to create an AI for themselves to help them interact with their community, and their customers if they\u2019re a business,\u201d he added.\nCreators may also want to use AIs to engage with fans, as they don\u2019t currently have time to respond to all the incoming messages.\nStill, he admitted that how good the AI avatars will ultimately be is going to become something of an \u201cart form\u201d that evolves and improves over time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we know going into this, what is going to be the most engaging and entertaining and trust-building formula for this,\u201d Zuckerberg noted. \u201cSo we want to give people tools so that you can experiment with this and see what ends up working well,\u201d he said.\nMeta will initially begin testing the feature with around 50 creators and a small percentage of users, and will then roll it out to more people over the next couple of months, with the hope of having it fully launched by August.\nMeta first announced its AI studio last year at its developer conference to let businesses build custom chatbots.\nAdditional reporting: Sarah Perez\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI, Microsoft sued by Center for Investigative Reporting\ndescription2:\nThe news industry just gained a powerful ally in its effort to take on OpenAI.\nThe Center for Investigative Reporting, the country's oldest nonprofit newsroom, sued OpenAI and lead backer Microsoft in federal court on Thursday for alleged copyright infringement, following similar suits from publications including The New York Times , Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News.\nThe CIR alleged in the suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, that OpenAI \"copied, used, abridged, and displayed CIR's valuable content without CIR's permission or authorization, and without any compensation to CIR.\"\nSince its public release in late 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has been crawling the web to provide answers to user queries, often relying heavily on copy pulled directly from news stories.\n\"When they populated their training sets with works of journalism, Defendants had a choice: to respect works of journalism, or not,\" the plaintiffs wrote in the lawsuit. \"Defendants chose the latter.\"\nIn a press release on Thursday, Monika Bauerlein, CEO of the nonprofit, accused the defendants of \"free rider behavior.\"\n\"OpenAI and Microsoft started vacuuming up our stories to make their product more powerful, but they never asked for permission or offered compensation, unlike other organizations that license our material,\" Bauerlein said.\nThe CIR, which is home to Mother Jones and audio programming Reveal, also alleged in the suit that OpenAI \"trained ChatGPT not to acknowledge or respect copyright. And they did this all without permission.\"\nThe group said it's seeking \"actual damages and Defendants' profits, or statutory damages of no less than $750 per infringed work and $2,500 per DMCA violation,\" referring to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nOpenAI and Microsoft didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWith the news industry broadly struggling to maintain sufficient advertising and subscription revenue to pay for its costly newsgathering operations, many publications are aggressively trying to protect their businesses as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent.\nIn December, The New York Times filed a suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging intellectual property violations related to its journalistic content appearing in ChatGPT training data. The Times said it seeks to hold Microsoft and OpenAI accountable for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of the Times's uniquely valuable works,\" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. OpenAI disagreed with the Times' characterization of events.\nThe Chicago Tribune, along with seven other newspapers, followed with a similar suit in April.\nOutside of news, a group of prominent U.S. authors, including Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult, sued OpenAI last year, alleging copyright infringement in using their work to train ChatGPT.\nBut not all news organizations are gearing up for a fight, and some are instead joining forces with OpenAI. Earlier on Thursday, OpenAI and Time magazine announced a \"multi-year content deal\" that will allow OpenAI to access current and archived articles from more than 100 years of Time's history.\nOpenAI will be able to display Time's content within its ChatGPT chatbot in response to user questions, according to a press release, and to use Time's content \"to enhance its products,\" or, likely, to train its artificial intelligence models.\nOpenAI announced a similar partnership in May with News Corp. , allowing OpenAI to access current and archived articles from The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Barron's, the New York Post and other publications. Reddit also announced in May that it will partner with OpenAI, allowing the company to train its AI models on Reddit content.\nWATCH: Microsoft gets put on AI backfoot after Apple-OpenAI deal\n\ntitle3:\nZuckerberg disses closed-source AI competitors as trying to 'create God'\ndescription3:\nRiffing on what he sees for the future of AI, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview published Thursday that he deeply believes that there will not be \u201cjust one AI.\u201d Touting the value of open source to put AI tools into many people\u2019s hands, Zuckerberg took a moment to disparage the efforts of unnamed competitors who he sees as less than open, adding that they seem to think they\u2019re \u201ccreating God.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that AI technology is a thing that should be kind of hoarded and \u2026 that one company gets to use it to build whatever central, single product that they\u2019re building,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a new YouTube interview with Kane Sutter (@Kallaway).\n\u201cI find it a pretty big turnoff when people in the tech industry \u2026 talk about building this \u2018one true AI,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if they kind of think they\u2019re creating God or something and \u2026 it\u2019s just \u2014 that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how this plays out.\u201d\n\u201cI get why, if you\u2019re in some AI lab \u2026 you want to feel like what you\u2019re doing is super important, right? \u2026 It\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019re building the one true thing for the future.\u2019 But I just think, like, realistically, that\u2019s not how stuff works, right?\u201d Zuckerberg explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there was one app on people\u2019s phones that people use. There\u2019s not one creator that people want all their content from. There\u2019s not one business that people want to buy everything from.\u201d\nIn the conversation, Zuckerberg said there needs to be a lot of different AIs that get created to reflect people\u2019s different interests. The company also on Thursday announced early tests of its AI Studio software in the U.S. that will allow creators and others to build AI avatars that will be able to reach people through Instagram\u2019s messaging system. The AIs will be able to answer questions from their followers and chat with people in a fun way but will be labeled as \u201cAI\u201d to not cause confusion.\nWhen referring to companies that build closed AI platforms, the Meta CEO said he didn\u2019t believe this is how to create the best experiences for people.\n\u201cYou want to unlock and \u2026 unleash as many people as possible trying out different things,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what culture is, right? It\u2019s not like one group of people getting to dictate everything for people.\u201d\nHis comments feel a bit like sour grapes, as they arrive shortly after reports emerged that Meta had tried to negotiate with Apple to integrate its AIs into Apple\u2019s operating systems, instead of only working with OpenAI at launch, but got shot down. According to Bloomberg, Apple decided to not move forward with formal discussions with Meta because it didn\u2019t believe its privacy practices were strong enough.\nWithout a deal, Meta loses access to potentially billions of iPhone users worldwide. But it appears that Meta\u2019s plan B is to build technology that expands beyond the smartphone.\nIn the interview, Zuckerberg touched on the progress the company is seeing with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, for example, saying that its path would one day converge with the work being done now on full holographic displays. However, the former will have more appeal in the near term, he said.\n\u201cI actually think you can create a great experience with cameras, and a microphone, and speakers and the ability to do multimodal AI, even before you have any kind of display on these glasses,\u201d he noted. Plus, not having a display keeps the costs down. Meta\u2019s smart glasses are around $300, and the Meta Quest Pro is $1,000, for comparison.\nZuckerberg said there will be three different products ahead of convergence: display-less smart glasses, a heads-up type of display and full holographic displays. Eventually, he said that instead of neural interfaces connected to their brain, people might one day wear a wristband that picks up signals from the brain communicating with their hand. This would allow them to communicate with the neural interface by barely moving their hand. Over time, it could allow people to type, too.\nZuckerberg cautioned that these types of inputs and AI experiences may not immediately replace smartphones, though. \u201cI don\u2019t think, in the history of technology, the new platform \u2014 it usually doesn\u2019t completely make it that people stop using the old thing. It\u2019s just that you use it less,\u201d he said.\nFor instance, people now use smartphones to do things they may have done on their computers 10 to 15 years ago.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s gonna happen with glasses, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to stop having a phone. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to stay in your pocket, and you\u2019ll take it out when you really need to do stuff with it. But more and more, I think people will just start saying, \u2018Hey, I can take this photo with my glasses. I can ask this question to AI, or I can send someone a message \u2014 it\u2019s just a lot easier with glasses,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if 10 years from now, we\u2019ll probably still have phones, but it\u2019s probably going to be much more intentional in usage as opposed to just reflexively reaching for it and grabbing it for any technological thing that you want to do,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle touts \u2018enterprise-ready\u2019 AI with more facts and less make-believe\ndescription4:\nVertex AI, the Google Cloud development platform that allows companies to build services using Google\u2019s machine learning and large language models, is getting new capabilities to help prevent apps and services from pushing inaccurate information. After rolling out general availability for Vertex AI\u2019s Grounding with Google Search feature in May \u2014 which enables models to retrieve live information from the internet \u2014 Google has now announced that customers will also have the option to improve their services\u2019 AI results with specialized third-party datasets.\nGoogle says the service will utilize data from providers like Moody\u2019s, MSCI, Thomson Reuters, and ZoomInfo and that grounding with third-party datasets will be available in \u201cQ3 this year.\u201d This is one of several new features that Google is developing to encourage organizations to adopt its \u201centerprise-ready\u201d generative AI experiences by reducing how often models spit out misleading or inaccurate information.\nAnother is \u201chigh-fidelity mode,\u201d which enables organizations to source information for generated outputs from their own corporate datasets instead of Gemini\u2019s wider knowledge bank. High-fidelity mode is powered by a specialized version of Gemini 1.5 Flash and is available now in preview via Vertex AI\u2019s Experiments tool.\nOrganizations can also allow Google\u2019s AI models to pull information from their own company datasets. Image: Google\nVector Search, which allows users to find images by referencing similar graphics, is also being expanded to support hybrid search. The update is available in public preview and allows those vector-based searches to be paired with text-based keyword searches to improve accuracy.
