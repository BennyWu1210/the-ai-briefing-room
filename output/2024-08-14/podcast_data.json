Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The latest financing was led by NEA and valued the company at over $1 billion, TechCrunch has learned from several people with knowledge of the investments. This was a $100 million round previously reported by the Financial Times in July.\nThis was a significant increase in valuation from World Labs\u2019 initial financing, which took place in April, and valued World Labs at $200 million, one person said. Investors in the first round included Andreessen Horowitz and Canadian firm Radical Ventures, where Li is a scientific partner, Reuters reported in May. Li and NEA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nWorld Labs, which was reportedly founded in April and went from founding to unicorn in four months, suggests that investors continue to place large bets on AI startups founded by prominent AI scientists, even if the startups businesses are unproven.\nIn the case of World Labs, what Li is working on is particularly difficult to do and could be essential in the AI-driven world that Silicon Valley is madly building. It\u2019s aiming to create AI models that can accurately estimate the three-dimensional physicality of real-world objects and environments, enabling detailed digital replicas without the need for extensive data collection.\nLi, widely known as a \u201cGodmother of AI,\u201d discussed how machines can be trained to develop human-like \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d in a TED talk earlier this year.\n\u201cVery little three-dimensional data exists in the world,\u201d said one investor familiar with World Labs\u2019 approach. \u201cAutonomous vehicle companies collect that data by driving thousands and thousands of miles to create three-dimensional data, which they then use to train their machines. In all other applications, like serving coffee, there\u2019s no three-dimensional data. Collecting that data is expensive because the universe of places you have to collect data is enormous.\u201d\nOnce available, World Labs\u2019 models can be used in gaming and robotics applications, she said.\nLi is best known for her work on ImageNet, a dataset that revolutionized computer vision. She is currently on partial leave until December 2025 from her role as co-director of Stanford\u2019s Human-Centered AI Institute.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle live Gemini demo lifts pressure on Apple as AI hits smartphones\ndescription1:\nRick Osterloh, Senior Vice President of Devices and Services at Google, speaks during the Made By Google event at Google's Bay View campus in Mountain View, California, on August 13, 2024. Google announced new Pixel phones, watches and AI technology.\nDuring Google's Pixel phone launch on Tuesday, a product director named David Citron took the stage to show off the mobile capabilities of the company's new AI assistant, Gemini. Things got awkward right after the presenter told the audience, \"all the demos today are live, by the way.\"\nIn front of a big crowd of media and analysts at Google's Silicon Valley headquarters and about 100,000 viewers on YouTube, Citron took a photo of a concert poster and asked the assistant to check his calendar to see if he's free the night pop star Sabrina Carpenter is playing in San Francisco.\nThe demo failed, freezing up and displaying an error message. Citron tried again, with the same result. After a quick verbal appeal to the \"demo gods,\" and a phone swap, the third try worked.\n\"Sure, I found that Sabrina Carpenter is coming to San Francisco on November 9, 2024,\" the assistant wrote in a message that popped up on Citron's screen. \"I don't see any events on your calendar during that time.\"\nWhile the incident was brief and buggy, the demo highlighted one of Google's advantages as artificial intelligence features make their way deeper into smartphone software. Rivals are preparing consumers for a future of AI, but Google's Gemini features are real and are shipping \u2014 at least for testing purposes \u2014 now.\nIn June, Apple presented a prerecorded video, rather than a live demo, to showcase its assistant Siri's forthcoming leap in capability to take actions and understand context under its new AI system called Apple Intelligence.\nApple Intelligence is currently in testing for developers, but some of its most critical improvements, including image generation, integration with ChatGPT and key advancements for its assistant Siri, haven't yet officially come out of Apple's labs.\nOpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI boom with ChatGPT, also often reveals AI advancements but strictly limits the number of people who can test them.\n\"I think what's new is that we've moved from the mode of, like projecting a vision of where things are headed to, like, actual shipping product,\" Rick Osterloh, Google devices chief, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa on Tuesday.\nGoogle's live demos mark a shift from late last year, when the company tried to show off Gemini in a demonstration, and ended up getting roundly criticized for editing the video.\n\"What we were showing today is the stuff that is shipping in the next few days or weeks, and that's really critical,\" Osterloh said. \"For a lot of the things that other companies have announced, they're really not available to many people. This is going to be available to millions of people very soon.\"\nAfter Apple's announcement in June, the company did some scripted live testing with media and analysts for Apple Intelligence on current devices. In July, Apple released a preview of some Apple Intelligence functions for developers, including the ability to generate summaries as well as a new look for Siri that makes the entire iPhone screen glow. However, the preview doesn't include functions like image generation, ChatGPT integration and the most anticipated improvements to Siri which will enable it to perform tasks naturally.\nGoogle's kickoff on Tuesday could put renewed pressure on Apple, as the two smartphone market leaders race to integrate AI into their operating systems. IDC estimates that \"Gen AI\" capable smartphones \u2014 phones with the chips and memory needed to run AI \u2014 will more than quadruple in units sold in 2024 to about 234 million devices.\n\"We got an idea today of what Apple is competing with,\" Grace Harmon, analyst at eMarketer, said in an interview.\nWith generative AI moving to phones, the market is also going to see a shift in AI processing. Instead of sophisticated models that emulate human output being run in huge Nvidia -based data centers, AI features for devices will rely on simpler functions like summarization or fluency, mainly running on the chips already inside the devices.\nIn Google's 100-minute presentation Tuesday, the company showed several capabilities that aren't yet available elsewhere.\nCitron's example \u2014 asking questions about the contents of a poster in a photo \u2014 highlights a technical advancement called \"multimodal AI,\" which isn't a planned Apple capability.\nThe company introduced a feature that lets users take screenshots of what they're viewing, and Google will compile that information into notes that can be quickly searched later.\nGoogle's most important presentation on Tuesday was Gemini Live, its next-generation assistant. In the demo, the technology was able to chat naturally, like a person, adding items to shopping lists or checking Google calendars. Soon, it will be able to help a user do deep research, Osterloh said on stage. Google executives attributed the capabilities to \"decades of investment\" in AI and its \"integrated AI strategy.\"\nAt one point, Google said its AI was a \"complete end-to-end experience that only Google can deliver,\" a tweak to a phrase that's long come from Apple. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, is fond of saying that \"only Apple\" can create its products because of its expertise integrating hardware and software.\nIn a press release, Google took a shot at Apple's forthcoming integration with ChatGPT, which is expected before the end of the year. The company said Apple's approach is less private than Google's, because Gemini \"doesn't require hand-off to a third-party AI provider you may not know or trust.\"\n\ntitle2:\nFTC finalizes rule banning fake reviews, including those made with AI\ndescription2:\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Wednesday a final rule that will tackle several types of fake reviews and prohibit marketers from using deceptive practices, such as AI-generated reviews, censoring honest negative reviews and compensating third parties for positive reviews.\nThe decision was the result of a 5-to-0 vote. The new rule will start being enforced 60 days after it\u2019s published in the official government publication called Federal Register.\nThe FTC\u2019s new rule has been a long time coming. It aims to improve the often untrustworthy online review system and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 make it easier for people to find reliable reviews. Merchants, especially on Amazon, have been using fake and paid reviews for far too long. Amazon claimed to cease more than 200 million fake reviews in 2020. In 2021, Yelp reported over 950 people \u201csuspicious groups, posts, or individuals\u201d were engaging in \u201cdeceptive review practices\u201d on online platforms. Now, the rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever for bad actors to write fake reviews.\nThe FTC initially proposed the rule on June 30, 2023, following an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking issued in November 2022.\nYou can read the finalized rule here, but we also included a summary of it below:\nNo fake or disingenuous reviews. This includes AI-generated reviews and reviews from anyone who doesn\u2019t have experience with the actual product.\nBusinesses can\u2019t sell or buy reviews, whether negative or positive.\nCompany insiders writing reviews need to clearly disclose their connection to the business. Officers or managers are prohibited from giving testimonials and can\u2019t ask employees to solicit reviews from relatives.\nCompany-controlled review websites that claim to be independent aren\u2019t allowed.\nNo using legal threats, physical threats or intimidation to forcefully delete or prevent negative reviews. Businesses also can\u2019t misrepresent that the review portion of their website comprises all or most of the reviews when it\u2019s suppressing the negative ones.\nNo selling or buying fake engagement like social media followers, likes or views obtained through bots or hacked accounts.\nAccording to the final rule, the maximum civil penalty for fake reviews is $51,744 per violation. However, the courts could impose lower penalties depending on the specific case.\n\u201cUltimately, courts will also decide how to calculate the number of violations in a given case,\u201d the Commission wrote.\n\ntitle3:\nVideo game industry faces sluggish 2024 sales growth, Newzoo says\ndescription3:\nAnalysts are expecting Nintendo to release a successor to its hit Switch console in its fiscal year 2025.\nThe global video game market is set for sluggish annual growth this year amid weak sales of gaming consoles, according to a new report from market research firm Newzoo.\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, Newzoo said the games industry is set to grow 2.1% year over year to an estimated $187.7 billion.\nThat is slightly down from an earlier January forecast in which the firm said it expects the video game industry to grow 2.8% to $189.3 billion in 2024.\nAlmost half of all consumer spending on games in 2024 is expected to come from the U.S. and China, Newzoo said, with the U.S. generating $47 billion of sales and China accounting for $45 billion.\nThough it's a step up from last year's growth rate of 0.6%, the games industry isn't experiencing the same growth rates it saw in the heady days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\ntitle4:\nDatabricks reportedly paid $2 billion in Tabular acquisition\ndescription4:\nAnalytics and AI giant Databricks reportedly paid nearly $2 billion when it acquired Tabular in June, a startup that was only doing $1 million in annual recurring revenue, according to Bloomberg. That\u2019s a pretty outrageous exit multiple, and it was purportedly fueled by a battle between Databricks and Snowflake.\nTabular had over $30 million in funding, backed by Altimeter Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Zetta Venture Partners, when it was acquired just three years after it was founded. Tabular\u2019s valuation was tied to Apache Iceberg, a popular open source table format that the startup\u2019s founders created while at Netflix. The startup quickly became an expensive pawn in the war between Databricks and Snowflake. In fact, some Databricks employees were reportedly asked to like or share their CEO\u2019s LinkedIn posts dunking on Snowflake, according to Bloomberg.\nSnowflake\u2019s stock price has fallen 36% this year, with its market cap of roughly $43 billion equal to Databricks\u2019 current valuation. It didn\u2019t help that Snowflake was linked to a massive data breach affecting \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s customers in July.\"\n\nResponse:",
