Reddit soars after announcing OpenAI deal on AI training models
description0:
The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange prepares for the social media platform Reddit's initial public offering in New York City on March 21, 2024.
Reddit shares surged 11% in extended trading on Thursday after the social media company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow the ChatGPT maker to train its artificial intelligence models on Reddit content.
As part of the deal, OpenAI will gain access to Reddit's Data application programming interface, or API, "which provides real-time, structured, and unique content from Reddit," according to a release.
In exchange, Reddit will begin offering certain AI features to users and moderators, powered by OpenAI, which will also become a Reddit advertising partner. Google announced a similar partnership with Reddit in February, allowing the company to train its AI models, such as Gemini, on Reddit content via access to the platform's API.
"Reddit has become one of the internet's largest open archives of authentic, relevant, and always up to date human conversations about anything and everything," CEO Steve Huffman said in Thursday's release. "Including it in ChatGPT upholds our belief in a connected internet, helps people find more or what they're looking for, and helps new audiences find community on Reddit."
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is a former board member and major shareholder in Reddit, with a stake valued at about $750 million after Thursday's pop. OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap spearheaded the deal, which was approved by the company's board, the release said.
Earlier this week, OpenAI launched a new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT, along with an updated user interface, the company's latest effort to expand use of its popular chatbot. The update brings GPT-4 to everyone, including OpenAI's free users, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said Monday in a livestreamed event.
Murati said the new model, GPT-4o, is "much faster," with improved capabilities in text, video and audio. OpenAI said it eventually plans to allow users to video chat with ChatGPT.
For Reddit, the deal provides another spark following a rally on Monday and Tuesday tied to a broader surge in so-called meme stocks such as GameStop . Reddit, which went public in March and reached a record close a few days after its initial public offering, is back to trading near its high of $65.11.

Meta slapped with child safety probe under sweeping EU tech law
description1:
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC.
Facebook parent company Meta on Thursday was hit with a major investigation from the European Union into alleged breaches of the bloc's strict online content law over child safety risks.
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said in a statement that it is investigating whether the social media giant's Facebook and Instagram platforms "may stimulate behavioural addictions in children, as well as create so-called 'rabbit-hole effects.'"
The commission added it is concerned about age verifications on Meta's platforms, as well as privacy risks linked to the company's recommendation algorithms.
"We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them," a Meta spokesperson told CNBC by email.
"This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission."
The commission said its decision to initiate an investigation comes of the back of a preliminary analysis of risk assessment report provided by Meta in September 2023.
Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for internal market, said in a statement that the regulator is "not convinced [that Meta] has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms."
The EU said it will carry out an in-depth investigation into Meta's child protection measures "as a matter of priority." The bloc can continue to gather evidence via requests for information, interviews, or inspections.

Microsoft offers relocation to hundreds of China-based AI staff
description2:
Microsoft has reportedly asked China-based cloud computing and artificial intelligence operations employees to consider relocating out of the country, as Washington cracks down on Beijing's access to the advanced technology.
The Wall Street Journal broke the story on Thursday, reporting that the staff, mostly comprising Chinese engineers, had been offered the opportunity to transfer to countries including the U.S., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, according to unnamed sources.
One source told WSJ that Microsoft had made the offer to about 700 to 800 people in total who were involved in machine learning and other work related to cloud computing.
CNBC could not independently verify the report.
In a statement shared with CNBC, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the company had "shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees" without supplying details on the number and affiliation of staff affected.
"We remain committed to the region and will continue to operate in this and other markets where we have a presence," the spokesperson said, adding that the potential transfers would not impact operations.
Microsoft employs roughly 7,000 engineers for its Asia-Pacific research-and-development group, with most of this workforce based in China, the WSJ reports.
The move comes amid U.S. efforts to prevent China from developing cutting-edge AI technology, which could be used for military purposes. In the past two years, the U.S. has placed waves of restrictions on China limiting its ability to buy advanced chips and chip-making equipment that can be deployed to train AI models.

Sony-backed Raspberry Pi heads for rare London IPO
description3:
British computing startup Raspberry Pi on Wednesday said it plans to list in London, in a rare win for the U.K. stock market.
Raspberry Pi, which makes tiny single-board computers, is considering an initial public offering on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. In a filing, the company said it plans to publish a registration document to make disclosures about its business as part of the IPO process.
The IPO is a win for the London stock market, which has been struggling to attract high-growth tech companies. A slew of major U.K. tech firms have chosen New York over London for their listings over the last year.
British chip designer Arm listed in September 2023 on the Nasdaq in New York, in a major blow to London's bid to attract large tech listings. More recently, British retail tech pioneer Ocado has faced calls from investors to move its listing from London to New York, according to the Sunday Telegraph.
Sky News reported on Tuesday that Klarna is eyeing up New York as the preferred venue for a highly anticipated IPO slated for early 2025. A Klarna spokesperson said the company has nothing to share on the location of an eventual IPO.

Figma tender offer values company at $12.5 billion
description4:
Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, speaks at the startup's Config conference in San Francisco on May 10, 2022.
Figma, a cloud-based design tool company, said Thursday it will allow investors, including current and former employees, to sell their shares in a tender offer that values the company at $12.5 billion.
That's up 25% from the valuation at which the company fundraised in 2021, but below the $20 billion acquisition offer Adobe made in 2022. Adobe and Figma called off the planned acquisition in December following regulatory scrutiny.
The San Francisco-based startup expects the size of the tender to be between $600 million and $900 million, with support from more than 25 current and new investors. A16z, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins are participating in the offer.
Figma is used by tens of thousands of employees inside Microsoft , which spends millions per year on its deployment. Google , Oracle and Salesforce also use the company's software.
In June 2021, during the heyday of mega financings, Figma was valued at $10 billion in a funding round that included participation from Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Global. That was before the 2022 market plunge sent many cloud stocks down by more than half and largely halted pre-IPO rounds.
Adobe initially said acquiring Figma would be a natural complement to the company's portfolio, writing in the original announcement that "the combination of Adobe and Figma will usher in a new era of collaborative creativity." In December, a regulatory filing said Adobe would pay Figma a $1 billion breakup fee.

reddit shares soared 11% in extended trading after announcing a partnership with openai. this collaboration will allow openai to train its ai models on reddit content through reddit's data api. in return, reddit will integrate ai features for users and moderators and welcome openai as an advertising partner. following a similar move by google in february, reddit's ceo, steve huffman, highlighted the platform's role as a vast archive of human conversations. openai recently launched a new ai model, gpt-4o, which boasts faster capabilities in text, video, and audio.

moving on, meta, the parent company of facebook, faces a major investigation by the european union over child safety risks. the eu is probing whether meta's platforms, facebook and instagram, induce behavioral addictions in children and create "rabbit-hole effects." the commission cited concerns about age verification and privacy risks linked to recommendation algorithms. meta's spokesperson emphasized the company's decade-long commitment to child safety, highlighting over 50 tools and policies developed to protect young users.

microsoft is reportedly offering relocation opportunities to hundreds of its china-based ai staff amid u.s. efforts to curb beijing's access to advanced technology. according to the wall street journal, around 700 to 800 employees involved in machine learning and cloud computing have been given the option to relocate to countries like the u.s., ireland, australia, and new zealand. a microsoft spokesperson confirmed the internal transfer opportunity, stating it wouldn't impact overall operations.

in a rare win for the u.k. stock market, british computing startup raspberry pi announced plans to list on the london stock exchange. known for its tiny single-board computers, the company sees this ipo as a significant milestone. london's stock market has struggled to attract high-growth tech firms, with many opting for new york instead. this listing aims to boost the u.k.'s profile in the tech sector.

lastly, figma, the cloud-based design tool company, is initiating a tender offer valuing the company at $12.5 billion. this offer allows investors, including current and former employees, to sell their shares. the valuation marks a 25% increase from figma's 2021 fundraising but falls short of adobe's $20 billion acquisition offer that was called off in december. the tender is expected to be between $600 million and $900 million, backed by over 25 investors, including a16z, sequoia, and kleiner perkins.
