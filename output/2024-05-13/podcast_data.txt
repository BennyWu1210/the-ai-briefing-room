High-performance memory chips are likely to remain in tight supply this year, as explosive AI demand drives a shortage for these chips, according to analysts.
SK Hynix and Micron – two of the world's largest memory chip suppliers – are out of high-bandwidth memory chips for 2024, while the stock for 2025 is also nearly sold out, according to the firms.
"We expect the general memory supply to remain tight throughout 2024," Kazunori Ito, director of equity research at Morningstar said in a report last week.
The demand for AI chipsets has boosted the high-end memory chip market, hugely benefiting firms such Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, the top two memory chipmakers in the world. While SK Hynix already supplies chips to Nvidia , the company is reportedly considering Samsung as a potential supplier too.
High-performance memory chips play a crucial role in the training of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which led AI adoption to skyrocket. LLMs need these chips to remember details from past conversations with users and their preferences to generate human-like responses to queries.
"The manufacturing of these chips are more complex and ramping up production has been difficult. This likely sets up shortages through the rest of 2024 and through much of 2025," said William Bailey, director at Nasdaq IR Intelligence.
HBM's production cycle is longer by 1.5 to 2 months compared with DDR5 memory chip commonly found in personal computers and servers, market intelligence firm TrendForce said in March.

Microsoft and Amazon to invest $5.6 billion into France
description1:
A Microsoft logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen and Amazon logo in the background in Athens, Greece on October 5, 2023.
Microsoft and Amazon are ploughing billions of dollars into France.
Microsoft said in a statement Monday that it's committing 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for France's technology industry.
The company said it plans to bring up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Microsoft will also train 1 million people and support 2,500 AI startups by 2027.
The announcement was made during the "Choose France" summit, a gathering dedicated to encouraging foreign investment in France.
“This major investment demonstrates a steadfast commitment to supporting digital innovation and economic growth in France,” said Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, in a statement Monday.
“We are building state-of-the-art Cloud and AI infrastructure, training people with AI skills, and supporting French startups as they use our technology with confidence to grow in a fair and responsible way.”
As part of its investment, Microsoft will also open a new data center in the French city of Mulhouse.
Amazon, meanwhile, made a commitment of its own to invest 1.2 billion euros in France.
The money will go toward creating more than 3,000 jobs in France — in addition to the 2,000 new jobs Amazon's already announced for 2024 — as well as broadly increasing the company's footprint in the country, according to Frederic Duval, Amazon's country manager.
"The expansion of our logistics network supports local economic development, creates quality jobs and allows us to reduce the carbon footprint of our deliveries while improving the overall customer experience," Duval said in a statement Monday.
Collectively, the commitments from Microsoft and Amazon to France amount to $5.6 billion of funding. In total, France reportedly bagged a record 15 billion euros of investment commitments from foreign companies at the annual Choose France summit on Monday.
French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to promote France as an artificial intelligence hub. Paris is already a major center of AI research and development, with Facebook having established one of its main AI labs, FAIR, there in 2015.
Last year, at the VivaTech technology fair in Paris, Macron announced 500 million euros in fresh funding to create new AI "champions," adding to previous commitments from the government, including a promise to pump 1.5 billion euros into AI before 2022.
Microsoft is also on a charm offensive of its own with its commitment to invest billions of euros into France at a time when French officials have expressed concerns with the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant's investment in AI startup Mistral.
Microsoft recently invested 15 million euros into Mistral. The deal saw Microsoft getting a stake in Mistral and the latter adding its large language model to the technology giant's Azure cloud computing platform.
Microsoft has pushed back on competition concerns surrounding its investment in Mistral, saying that the company remains independent and that its partnership is a minority equity investment and a commercial relationship, not a merger. Britain's competition regulator is seeking feedback on the deal.

OpenAI launches new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT
description2:
OpenAI, backed by Microsoft , has been valued by more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.
"This is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use," Murati said.
The update brings GPT-4 to everyone, including OpenAI's free users, technology chief Mira Murati said in a livestreamed event. She added that the new model, GPT-4o, is "much faster," with improved capabilities in text, video and audio. OpenAI said it eventually plans to allow users to video chat with ChatGPT.
OpenAI on Monday launched a new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT, along with an updated user interface, the company's latest effort to expand use of its popular chatbot.
The o in GPT-4o stands for omni. The new model allows ChatGPT to handle 50 different languages with improved speed and quality, and it will also be available via OpenAI's API making it possible for developers to begin building applications using the new model today, Murati said.
She added that GPT-4o is twice as fast as, and half the cost of, GPT-4 Turbo.
OpenAI team members demonstrated the new model's audio capabilities, for example, asking it to help calm someone down ahead of a public speech. OpenAI researcher Mark Chen said the model is able to "perceive your emotion," adding the model can also handle users interrupting it. The team also asked it to analyze a user's facial expression to comment on the emotions the person may be experiencing.
"Hey there, what's up? How can I brighten your day today?" ChatGPT's audio mode said when a user greeted it.
The company plans to test Voice Mode in the coming weeks, with early access for paid subscribers to ChatGPT Plus, according to a blog post. OpenAI also said the new model can respond to users' audio prompts "in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation."
Chen demonstrated the model's ability to tell a bedtime story and asked it to change the tone of its voice to be more dramatic or robotic. He even asked it to sing the story.
In addition, OpenAI's new model can function as a translator, even in audio mode, the company said. Chen demonstrated the tool's ability to listen to Murati speaking Italian while he spoke English and to translate into their respective languages as they conversed.
Team members also demonstrated the model's ability to solve math equations and help write code, positioning it as a stronger competitor to Microsoft's own GitHub Copilot.
For OpenAI, the launch was one of the company's biggest announcements since the August kickoff of ChatGPT Enterprise, the AI chatbot's business tier. That tool was in development for "under a year" and had the help of more than 20 companies of varying sizes and industries, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC at the time.
OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are at the helm of a generative AI gold rush as companies in seemingly every industry race to add AI-powered chatbots and agents to key services to avoid being left behind by competitors. Earlier this month, OpenAI rival Anthropic announced its first-ever enterprise offering and a free iPhone app.
A record $29.1 billion was invested across nearly 700 generative AI deals in 2023, an increase of more than 260% from the prior year, according to PitchBook. The market is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.
Some in the industry have raised concerns about the speed at which untested new services are coming to market, and academics and ethicists are distressed about the technology's tendency to propagate bias.
After ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, it broke records at the time as the fastest-growing consumer app in history, and now has about 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI says that more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies are using the platform.
Murati said during the Monday event that OpenAI wants to "remove some of the mysticism from the technology."
"Over the next few weeks, we'll be rolling out these capabilities to everyone," she said.
The new model will first roll out on Tuesday to customers of ChatGPT Plus and Team, and then to Enterprise later, a blog post on Monday said. It will also be available to free users of ChatGPT starting Monday, with usage limits. Users of ChatGPT Plus will have five times more message capacity than free users, and clients of ChatGPT Team and Enterprise will have even greater usage limits.
Murati concluded the livestreamed event by thanking Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his company for providing the necessary graphics processing units (GPUs) to power OpenAI's technology.
"I just want to thank the incredible OpenAI team, and also thanks to Jensen and the Nvidia team for bringing us the most advanced GPUs to make this demo possible today," she said.

Google and Apple partner to fight location tracker stalking
description3:
Apple and Google announced Monday that updated iPhones and Android phones will show alerts warning users that there is a wireless location tracking device nearby, in case the user was not aware they were being tracked and wants to stop it.
The move is the latest sign that the two major platforms are working to fix the downside of wireless trackers — such as Apple's AirTag — that can be useful for finding lost or stolen objects by displaying their location on a digital map, but can also be used by criminals to track people.
IPhone and Android devices with up-to-date software will receive a message telling them that a Bluetooth tracker is "found moving with you." Users can then have the tracker play a sound to make it easier to find, and access instructions on how to disable it.
When AirTags were first introduced by Apple in 2021, they quickly found an audience among users who would attach the tiny devices to their keys, luggage or even their car, allowing them to use Apple's global network of devices and crowdsourced Bluetooth signals to quickly locate their lost objects, such as checked baggage that never arrived after a flight.
But the devices were also used for crime, and some victims said they were slipped an AirTag at a crowded bar to be tracked. Since then, Apple has been working with Google to integrate alerts and warnings into iOS and Android to tamp down criminal misuse. Alerts specifically warning against an AirTag traveling with the user were already built into Android.
The AirTag is also now just one of many Bluetooth trackers. Apple and Google allow third-party companies, such as Chipolo and Motorola, to build their own devices.
But when third-party companies build so-called "Find My" lost device trackers, they have to build them to Apple and Google's specifications, which will now require unwanted tracking alerts.
Apple and Google said they were working together to create a public industry specification for these kinds of Bluetooth tracker devices, but although the official standard is not finished, both companies have implemented the alerts into their operating systems, starting with Apple's iOS 17.5, which will be released on Monday, and Android devices with version 6.0 or newer.

Melinda French Gates to leave Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
description4:
Melinda Gates, co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation arrives at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France on July 01, 2021.
Melinda French Gates, the former wife of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, announced on Monday she would resign as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation next month.
French Gates said in a statement on X that it was a "critical moment" to protect and advance women's rights around the world. The announcement comes almost exactly three years after the Gates' announced their divorce.
She said she will have "an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families" as a result of her resignation and the Gates' divorce agreement. The couple divorced in May 2021.
Bill Gates said in a separate statement, "I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work."
The Gates Foundation's work has focused on worldwide anti-poverty and global health initiatives, including anti-malaria efforts in Africa, and extensive investment across the Indian subcontinent and South Asia.
French Gates has also devoted significant amounts of time and money toward gender-equality initiatives worldwide. In 2015, she founded Pivotal Ventures, a separate entity from the Gates Foundation, which is focused on removing barriers to access and opportunity for minorities and women in the U.S."
