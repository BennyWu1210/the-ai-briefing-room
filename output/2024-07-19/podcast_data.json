Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The outage \u2014 linked to a software update from popular cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike \u2014 has affected computers running Microsoft Windows at organizations across various sectors, including airlines, banks, retailers, brokerage houses, media companies and railway networks. The travel sector seems to be one of the hardest hit, based on online chatter.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s chief executive, George Kurtz, confirmed in a post on X that a \u201cdefect\u201d in a content update for Windows hosts had caused the outage, and Kurtz ruled out a cyberattack. He added that the firm was rolling out a fix and that Mac and Linux hosts were not affected.\n\u201cCrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted,\u201d Kurtz noted on X.\n\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they\u2019re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers,\u201d Kurtz said.\nLater Friday, the U.S. cyber agency, the CISA, said that even though the outage wasn\u2019t linked to any suspicious activity, it has \u201cobserved threat actors taking advantage of this incident for phishing and other malicious activity.\u201d\nA post on CrowdStrike\u2019s support forums (which are only accessible with a login) also acknowledged the issue early on Friday, saying the company had received reports of crashes related to a content update. CrowdStrike said the crash reports were \u201crelated to the Falcon Sensor\u201d \u2014 its cloud-based security service that it describes as \u201creal-time threat detection, simplified management, and proactive threat hunting.\u201d\nA screenshot of the post on CrowdStrike. Image Credits: CrowdStrike\nA moderator of the CrowdStrike subreddit also said the company was aware of \u201cwidespread reports\u201d of blue screen errors on Windows devices across multiple versions of its software. The firm was investigating the cause, the message read.\nThe security firm didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMicrosoft started to note problems starting in the early hours of July 19. Its Service Health page notes currently that Microsoft 365 for Consumers is now back up. Enterprise apps, however, are still seeing disruption according to its Service Health Status for its cloud services for business.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of an issue affecting Windows devices due to an update from a third-party software platform. We anticipate a resolution is forthcoming,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.\nThe Microsoft spokesperson said that the previous Microsoft 365 service disruption overnight July 18 to 19 was unrelated to the widespread outage triggered by the CrowdStrike update.\nThere will be a lot of questions to ask and answer about resilience \u2014 or perhaps the lack of it \u2014 in cloud services, and namely how one single update could bring so much to a grinding halt around the world.\n\u201cIn our view, cybersecurity products have to clear a higher bar of reliability and security in customer deployments than other technology products because they are mission critical and actively attacked by adversaries,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note Friday. \u201cIn some ways, we believe this will reinforce the barrier to entry in the industry and the need for best-in-class update, outage and customer service protocols, ultimately favoring companies with scale.\u201d\nAirlines and airports across Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Australia, China, Japan, India, Singapore and Taiwan are reporting problems with check-in and ticketing systems, resulting in flight delays and ample chaos at airports.\nU.S. federal airspace officials announced a nationwide ground stop of air traffic on Friday due to the outages, which might have an affect on the climate, experts told TechCrunch. Others were affected by the outage and the airline chaos in other ways.\nIn the U.K., the London Stock Exchange reported disruptions. Several doctors\u2019 offices in the U.K. said on X that the outage had hit the National Health Service\u2019s clinical computer system that contains medical records and is used for scheduling appointments.\nAnd in the U.S., some 911 and non-emergency call centers seem to be affected. A post by Alaska State Troopers said many such call centers were \u201cnot working correctly across the State of Alaska.\u201d\nU.K. news broadcaster Sky News faced trouble broadcasting live this morning due to the outage, the firm\u2019s executive chairman David Rhodes tweeted. The New Zealand Herald reported that banking services in the country were affected by the issue, too, and several Indian news channels said they had problems broadcasting as well.\nMany companies\u2019 employees have reported being unable to start their computers due to the issue. The outage came shortly after Microsoft confirmed service problems with its Microsoft 365 apps late on Thursday, which affected several airlines including Delta and United. Microsoft\u2019s services status page says the issues are being resolved.\nAnd amid the chaos, misinformation has been spreading, including that the Las Vegas Sphere was displaying a blue screen of death.\nBefore CrowdStrike acknowledged its role in the crash, businesses and security experts early on Friday began to point fingers at the company, whose software is used by millions of people across enterprises to manage security both on devices and servers. Experts told TechCrunch that rivals could stand to gain from the debacle, as well.\nCrowdStrike counts nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies and more than half of the Fortune 1,000 among its clients, per its website. Its services are deployed by eight of the top 10 financial services firms and an equal number of leading tech companies. It also has a deep and wide presence in the healthcare and manufacturing sectors, serving six and seven of the top 10 companies in those industries, respectively.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s shares were down around 11% when the market closed on Friday, and a market cap of $74.2 billion at the time of this writing.\nRam Iyer, Ingrid Lunden and Zack Whittaker contributed to this report.\nThe Microsoft / CrowdStrike outage has taken down most airports in India.

The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\" Kurts said in a post on social media platform X.\nMicrosoft , which also reported issues affecting its Azure cloud services and Microsoft 365 suite of apps, closed down .74%.\nA multitude of different websites went down Friday morning, as planes were grounded and TV studios paused broadcasting, amid an ongoing major IT outage.\nEarlier on Friday, CrowdStrike was hit with a major outage caused by an issue with an update affecting its Falcon Sensor product, which is designed to stop cyber breaches using cloud technology. CrowdStrike is now in the process of rolling back the update globally.\n\u201cCrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor,\u201d CrowdStrike told NBC News in a recorded phone message.\nCybersecurity experts said the update issue at CrowdStrike was responsible for directly affecting Windows systems around the world, with laptops showing an error screen known as the \u201cblue screen of death.\"\nIt comes after Microsoft said earlier on Friday that its cloud services had been mostly restored after it suffered an outage affecting its cloud apps in the U.S. It is not clear whether this outage was linked to CrowdStrike\u2019s update.\nThe global outage shows how a single point of failure in the cyber supply chain can be responsible for huge ripple effects globally.\n\ntitle2:\nTwitch lifts its ban on Donald Trump\ndescription2:\nTwitch has reinstated former President Donald Trump\u2019s account after \u201cindefinitely\u201d suspending him following the January 6th, 2021, attacks on the US Capitol.\n\u201cWe reinstated former President Trump\u2019s Twitch channel,\u201d a Twitch spokesperson, who asked to remain anonymous due to safety concerns, says in a statement. \u201cWe believe there is value in hearing from Presidential nominees directly, when possible. Trump is now the official Republican nominee for US president.\u201d (Trump accepted the GOP nomination for president Thursday night.)\n\u201cWe continue to enforce our Community Guidelines and take necessary enforcement action when we identify violations of our rules,\u201d says the spokesperson. \u201cTwitch doesn\u2019t have a \u2018public figure policy,\u2019 meaning all channels are equally subject to our guidelines, regardless of whether the channel belongs to a public figure.\u201d\nIn 2021, Twitch disabled Trump\u2019s channel the day after the attacks before indefinitely banning him on January 20th \u201cdue to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence,\u201d a Twitch spokesperson said at the time.\n\ntitle3:\nMicrosoft on CrowdStrike outage: have you tried turning it off and on? (15 times)\ndescription3:\nHave you turned it off and on again? That familiar refrain from IT departments and The IT Crowd is being echoed by Microsoft today as a recommended way of fixing the faulty CrowdStrike update that has taken down thousands of Windows PCs and servers today.\nIn a support note on Microsoft\u2019s Azure outage page, the company says it has heard from customers that rebooting virtual machines and PCs multiple times can help. \u201cWe have received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d says Microsoft.\nIf rebooting a machine 15 times doesn\u2019t do the trick, Microsoft recommends the workaround that many IT admins have been using today, which involves deleting the faulty CrowdStrike driver. In the case of Microsoft\u2019s Azure virtual machines, it should be easier for IT admins to mount a disk and attempt to delete the faulty file rather than having to boot machines into Safe Mode.\nWe\u2019ve heard from some IT admins that rebooting is indeed fixing the problems. It\u2019s amazing that one of the worst global IT outages in history can be fixed by just turning it off and on again. A meme saves the day.\"\n\nResponse:",
