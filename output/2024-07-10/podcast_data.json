On Tuesday, Musk defeated one of those lawsuits, as a federal judge ruled X Corp. doesn\u2019t owe the ex-employees any more severance.\nThe lawsuit, filed by Twitter\u2019s former head of people experience and another ex-manager, alleged that X Corp. paid fired Twitter employees less severance than they were contractually promised. The complaint stated Twitter offered these 6,000 fired employees, at most, three months of severance pay, which Musk confirmed in a tweet at the time. Twitter\u2019s Severance Plan, which was in effect since 2019, had previously promised senior employees upwards of six months of severance pay, according to the complaint.\nThe plaintiff estimated Musk owed these former employees upwards of $500 million, citing protections under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\nRegarding Twitter\u2019s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.\nEveryone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 4, 2022\nU.S. District Judge Trina Thompson dismissed the class action lawsuit in San Francisco on Tuesday.\nIn a court filing, Judge Thompson said the ERISA protections did not apply because Musk\u2019s company notified employees shortly after the October 2022 takeover that fired employees would only receive cash payouts. Because of this notice, the mass firings that occurred in November were not under Twitter\u2019s previous severance plan, according to the judge.\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the ruling and considering our options for moving forward,\u201d said a spokesperson for Sanford Heisler Sharp, the law firm representing the plaintiffs in this case, in an email to TechCrunch.\nSince the November 2022 firings, X Corp. has operated the social media platform with a bare-bones staff. Musk told the BBC in 2023 that he brought Twitter\u2019s staff down to 1,500 employees, from roughly 8,000 before his takeover, citing major cost-cutting efforts. Despite the efforts, X has continued to struggle, as documents obtained by Bloomberg showed the company lost $456 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nMusk is not out of the water yet for these mass firings. In another lawsuit, Agrawal and three other former Twitter Inc. executives are seeking $128 million in severance payments from X Corp. after they were let go in the mass firing. Another lawsuit from former senior employees at Twitter seeks more than $1 million in severance payments, but Musk says he never agreed to these former employees\u2019 benefit plans.\nThis article was updated on July 10 at 12:48 PM PDT to include comments from Sanford Heisler Sharp.\n\ntitle1:\nPrice, specs, feature, availability\ndescription1:\nThe Samsung Galaxy Ring has the ability to track various health metrics such as heart rate. It is Samsung's first foray into the smart ring category of product as it hopes to keep users locked into its ecosystem of devices from smartwatches to smartphones. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\nPARIS \u2014 Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring on Wednesday, its first foray into \"smart rings.\" The South Korean tech giant is looking to integrate its products \u2014 such as smartphones and wearables \u2014 and offer health-tracking features to rival Apple 's push into the space. The Galaxy Ring, which Samsung has teased for the past few months, is a lightweight ring equipped with sensors designed for health monitoring 24 hours a day, the company said at its Galaxy Unpacked event Wednesday in Paris. Samsung's push into a new product category comes at a time when smartphone sales are making a slight recovery but users are holding on to their handsets for longer. Device makers are looking for add-on electronics products to sell. For Samsung, the Galaxy Ring adds a new device to its portfolio that can track health features alongside its smartphones and smartwatches. Over the past few years, Samsung has been trying to market its health applications \u2014 which are increasingly popular among consumers \u2014 as a big reason to buy such products.\nAnd Samsung is positioning the ring as a device to be worn alongside its smartwatches and with a smartphone, powered by artificial intelligence software, to offer a comprehensive picture of a person's health, a move which could help drive sales to its other products. \"This will be the star of the show with all eyes on this new device and category for Samsung,\" Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight, told CNBC. Pescatore said the ring is a \"product that could help drive smartphones sales and migrate users over to its platform.\"\nGalaxy Ring key features and price\nSamsung says the Galaxy Ring can monitor the following things: Sleep: The device can monitor a person's movement during sleep, sleep latency, heart and respiratory rate, and give analysis of the quality of sleep. Menstrual cycle: Samsung says it uses skin temperature to help track a person's menstrual cycle. Heart rate: The Galaxy Ring can inform users when their heart rate is unusually high or low. Users can also check their heart rate in real time. Exercise: The Galaxy Ring can detect the kind of workout or activity a person is doing. The Galaxy Ring weighs between 2.3 grams and 3 grams, depending on what size you buy. The device comes in three colors. Samsung says the Galaxy Ring's battery can last up to seven days. There's a portable charging case, as with wireless air buds. The Samsung Galaxy Ring will be available on July 24 and starts at $399.99.\nSamsung ecosystem play\nOn Wednesday, Samsung also took the wraps off its latest smartwatches \u2014 the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. It's the first time the company has released an \"Ultra\" model of its smartwatch, a device designed for athletes and those into activities like hiking and mountain climbing.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (left) and Galaxy Watch7 (right) are the South Korean giant's latest smartwatches. It is the first time Samsung has released an \"Ultra\" version of its wearable. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\nThe watches include new sensors and sports tracking features. Samsung also launched its latest foldable devices on Wednesday: the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. With the ring, Samsung is trying to tie users more closely to its ecosystem of products. For example, when the smartwatch is connected to the phone, users can use a \"double pinch\" action with their fingers to answer calls or take a picture. When the Galaxy Ring, smartwatch and phone are paired together, Samsung said, users get a more detailed picture of their health, especially when sleeping, because the devices are taking data from more sources. Samsung said the battery life of the ring is extended when worn together with the smartwatch. \"Indeed, the watch and the ring are part of expanding the ecosystem, which will become increasingly important as AI technology is laid on top of the data collected from different devices. The more devices a user has from the same brand, the more comprehensive the data collected, enhancing the effectiveness of AI digital assistants,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for devices research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at IDC, told CNBC by email. \"This truly personalized experience will drive users to choose devices from one brand over another.\" Samsung, like Apple, has been pushing the interconnectedness of its devices over the past years to keep users engaged.\nwatch now\n\"It is little surprise that Samsung is doubling-down on linking its products with an 'ecosystem story.' Apple has shown that driving interdependence between products is an extremely effective way of locking consumers into a specific brand,\" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC.\nRing is a 'niche' product\n\ntitle2:\nMeta will soon let kids aged 10 to 12 interact with others in VR with their parents' approval\ndescription2:\nMeta announced on Wednesday that users aged 10 to 12 will soon be able to interact with others in VR if they have their parents\u2019 approval to do so. Up until now, children were not able to chat or interact with other users on Quest.\nIn an upcoming update, Meta is adding the ability for parents to individually add approved contacts that their child can chat with or call, and send or accept invites to join them in parent-approved VR experiences.\nBy opening up its VR experiences to children, Meta is hoping younger users will familiarize themselves with the technology, which could make them more likely to use it as they age. It could also help Meta take on other companies like Roblox and Microsoft\u2019s Minecraft, both of which are popular among young users.\nMeta explains that users will only become approved contacts once a parent adds them. Parents can manage approved contacts by adding them to their child\u2019s Following and Followers list. Children can request a follower to become an approved contact, and parents have the option to delete an approved contact at any time.\nLast year, Meta lowered the recommended age for using its Quest headset from 13 to 10. The company then launched parent-managed accounts that give users between the ages of 10 and 12 access to age-appropriate VR experiences on Quest.\nVR is a relatively newer technology and risks around its use are still somewhat unknown, which has promoted child safety concerns from parents, rights groups, and researchers.\nMeta\u2019s decision to bring social features to children\u2019s accounts on Quest comes as Congress is putting increased pressure on social media companies like Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat to protect children on their platforms.\n\ntitle3:\nAWS App Studio promises to generate enterprise apps from a written prompt\ndescription3:\nGenerative AI is everywhere these days, but Amazon Web Services has been perceived in some circles as being late to the game. In reality it\u2019s still early, and the market is still shaking out. On Wednesday, AWS might have raised its generative AI street cred with a new tool called App Studio.\nApp Studio promises to help you create an enterprise software application from a written prompt. That\u2019s correct: You simply describe the program you want, and AWS says it will write the code for you without the need for any professional developers.\n\u201cApp Studio is for technical folks who have technical expertise but are not professional developers, and we\u2019re enabling them to build enterprise-grade apps,\u201d Sriram Devanathan, GM of Amazon Q Apps and AWS App Studio, told TechCrunch.\nAmazon defines enterprise apps as having multiple UI pages with the ability to pull from multiple data sources, perform complex operations like joins and filters, and embed business logic in them.\nIt is aimed at IT professionals, data engineers and enterprise architects, even product managers who might lack coding skills but have the requisite company knowledge to understand what kinds of internal software applications they might need. The company is hoping to enable these employees to build applications by describing the application they need and the data sources they wish to use.\nExamples of the types of applications include an inventory-tracking system or claims approval process. The user starts by entering the name of an application, calling the data sources and then describing the application they want to build. The system comes with some sample prompts to help, but users can enter an ad hoc description if they wish.\nIt then builds a list of requirements for the application and what it will do, based on the description. The user can refine these requirements by interacting with the generative AI. In that way, it\u2019s not unlike a lot of no-code tools that preceded it, but Devanathan says it is different.\n\u201cWhere App Studio is different is in the way we use GenAI to really reduce your learning curve. I\u2019d say there\u2019s almost no learning curve. The typical no-code tools you have to understand their paradigm. You have to understand the visual interface. You kind of have to really, over time, build some expertise,\u201d he said.\nOnce the application is complete, it goes through a mini DevOps pipeline where it can be tested before going into production. In terms of identity, security and governance, and other requirements any enterprise would have for applications being deployed, the administrator can link to existing systems when setting up the App Studio. When it gets deployed, AWS handles all of that on the back end for the customer, based on the information entered by the admin.\nApp Studio uses multiple models running on Amazon Bedrock, including Amazon Titan and Anthropic, depending on the job, according to Devanathan.\nApp Studio is available in preview starting Wednesday.\n\ntitle4:\nApple warns of mercenary spyware attacks in 98 countries\ndescription4:\nApple has issued a new round of threat notifications to iPhone users across 98 countries, warning them of potential mercenary spyware attacks. It\u2019s the second such alert campaign from the company this year, following a similar notification sent to users in 92 nations in April.\nSince 2021, Apple has been regularly sending these notifications, reaching users in over 150 countries, according to a support document on the company\u2019s website. The Wednesday warning did not disclose the attackers\u2019 identities or the countries where users received notifications.\n\u201cApple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,\u201d the company wrote in the warning to affected customers.\n\u201cThis attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it\u2019s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning \u2014 please take it seriously,\u201d Apple added in the text.\nUsers in India are among those who have received Apple\u2019s latest threat notifications, according to user testimonials. In October, Apple sent similar warnings to several journalists and politicians in the country. Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, later reported discovering the presence of Pegasus, a highly invasive spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, on the iPhones of prominent Indian journalists.\nIn its communication to impacted users, Apple stressed the sensitive nature of its threat identification methods, cautioning that divulging additional details could potentially aid attackers in evading future detection.\nApple has also made a notable shift in its language since last year, opting to describe these incidents as \u201cmercenary spyware attacks\u201d instead of the previously used term \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d attacks.\nApple said it relies solely on \u201cinternal threat-intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
