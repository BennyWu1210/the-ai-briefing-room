Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is a major defeat for Google that could alter the way it does business and even change the structure of the internet as we know it, should the decision stand.\nMehta said that Google abused its monopoly power over the search business in part by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default choice on their devices and web browsers. The Justice Department and states filed the antitrust suit against Google in 2020, which kicked off in court in September 2023.\nGoogle pays companies, including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, billions of dollars for prime placement in web browsers and on smartphones. In 2021 alone, Google spent $26 billion to be the default search engine across Apple and Android platforms. According to The New York Times, about $18 billion of that spend went to Apple alone. Google shares 36% of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple. The government has argued that paying for the dominant position effectively kneecapped competitors from being able to build up their own search engines to a scale that would give them the data and reach to stay competitive.\n\u201cAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\u201d Mehta wrote in his opinion filed Monday. \u201cIt has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\u201d\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal for any person or business to monopolize, attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s president of Global Affairs, told TechCrunch the company plans to appeal the decision. Walker doubled down on Google\u2019s previous arguments that it has used its dominant position to make the best and most useful search engine, which has benefited consumers and advertisers alike.\n\u201cThis decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make it easily available,\u201d Walker told TechCrunch. \u201cWe appreciate the Court\u2019s finding that Google is \u2018the industry\u2019s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users\u2019, that Google \u2018has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices\u2019, \u2018has continued to innovate in search\u2019 and that \u2018Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google\u2019s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google\u2019s to be superior.\u2019\u201d\nThe opinion caps off a years-long case \u2014 U.S. et al. v. Google \u2014 that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Department of Justice and a group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020, alleging that Google unfairly blocked out would-be search rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo. The Department of Justice estimated that Google had a 90% share of the search market, a figure that Google disputed.\nThe outcome of the case is a significant win for the Justice Department in an election year when former president Donald Trump would, should he win a second term in office, almost certainly take a decidedly more hands-off, deregulatory approach to tech. President Joe Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, has garnered a reputation for coming after big tech, particularly in regards to antitrust law, that many of those companies have not taken kindly to.\nThis case could set precedent for the raft of other antitrust lawsuits making their way through the courts today. The DOJ has sued Apple for making it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone. The FTC has also recently sued Meta for stamping out early competitors and Amazon for squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.\nJudge Mehta\u2019s decision Monday may also impact the outcome of the Justice Department\u2019s second antitrust suit against Google, which alleges that Google illegally monopolized the digital ads market. Arguments for that case are scheduled to begin September 9.\nThe judge has yet to decide remedies for Google\u2019s behavior. He could force the company to change the way it runs its search business \u2014 or order it to sell off parts of that business. The opinion could be appealed, of course, and the final verdict may differ significantly, as happened with Microsoft\u2019s famed antitrust case in the dot-com era.\nIn that case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated antitrust laws and ordered the company to be split into two entities. Microsoft appealed the decision, and an appeals court overturned the breakup order, but Microsoft still had to take certain steps that experts today say might influence Mehta\u2019s behavioral remedies for Google. As part of Microsoft\u2019s settlement, the company had to share its APIs with third-party companies and appoint a panel to monitor its compliance.\nUpdate: This article was originally published August 5 at 12:20 p.m. PT. It has been updated with more context and information from Google.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk revives lawsuit against OpenAI, Sam Altman in federal court\ndescription1:\nIn this photo, the logo of OpenAI is displayed on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying the photographs of Elon Musk and Sam Altman, in Ankara, Turkey, on March 14, 2024.\nElon Musk has revived a lawsuit against Sam Altman in federal court, alleging that the Tesla boss was manipulated into co-founding OpenAI, according to a court filing published Monday.\nThe crux of Musk's claims center around his view that he was \"courted and deceived\" by Altman and current OpenAI President Greg Brockman into co-founding the artificial intelligence firm on the basis that it was a nonprofit.\nAfter Musk came on board and invested millions of dollars, the lawsuit claims he was \"betrayed by Altman and his accomplices\" as they, along with Microsoft , \"established an opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates, engaged in rampant self-dealing.\"\n\"The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,\" the lawsuit alleges.\nThe claims in the new lawsuit are similar to another lawsuit filed by Musk against OpenAI and Altman in California this year, which the Tesla and SpaceX boss ultimately dropped.\nMusk has been very vocal over the past few years about his fear of artificial intelligence and the dangers it poses to humanity. Musk states in the latest lawsuit, filed in a district court in Northern California, that he was \"manipulated\" into co-founding OpenAI by Altman and Brockman, who allegedly promised \"that it would chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants.\"\n\"Altman assured Musk that the non-profit structure guaranteed neutrality and a focus on safety and openness for the benefit of humanity, not shareholder value. But as it turns out, this was all hot-air philanthropy\u2014the hook for Altman's long con,\" the lawsuit claims.\nCNBC has reached out to Tesla, OpenAI and Microsoft for comment.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Microsoft was involved in the situation.\nIdentifying OpenAI as a nonprofit with no shareholders, the lawsuit states that Microsoft \"sought to obtain leverage in other ways by, for example, enticing OpenAI, Inc. to use and become inextricably dependent on Microsoft's cloud computing system.\"\n\"While Musk expressed a liking for Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella \u2026 the values of the company and OpenAI, Inc. did not align,\" the lawsuit claims.\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI and has poured a reported $13 billion into the company.\n\"Over the course of the next few years and continuing to today, Microsoft methodically entrenched itself further into OpenAI,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.\n\ntitle2:\n$1 trillion wipeout: Market rout punishes megacap tech\ndescription2:\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on July 31, 2024.\nAs U.S. markets opened for trading on Monday, tech's megacap companies lost about $1 trillion in market cap, deepening a downturn that sent the Nasdaq into correction territory last week.\nNvidia shed more than $300 billion in market cap at the opening bell, though it quickly recovered about half of its loss. Shares of the chipmaker closed down 6.4% for a loss of $168 billion. Apple and Amazon's valuation plummeted $224 billion and $109 billion, respectively, at the market open. Apple ended down 4.8%, or $162 billion in market cap. Amazon dropped 4.1% at the close, or $72 billion.\nAdd all that to steep declines in Meta , Microsoft , Alphabet and Tesla , and the seven most-valuable tech companies lost $995 billion in the early moments of trading. They bounced back some as trading progressed.\nMarkets fell broadly on Monday as concerns about a recession stemming from disappointing economic data last week pushed Japan's Nikkei 225 down 12% on Monday, its worst day since the 1987 \"Black Monday\" crash on Wall Street. Bitcoin plummeted 11%, leading a sell-off in cryptocurrency and related stocks.\nWithin technology, investors have been getting nervous for weeks. The Nasdaq slumped 3.4% last week, wrapping up its worst three-week stretch in two years, before losing another 3.4% on Monday. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all gave Wall Street reasons for concern in their reports, contributing to a slide among their peers.\nIt is a sharp change from a few months ago, when investors cheered as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai both said their companies were spending heavily to build out their artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nNvidia, a company unknown to most Americans, was the biggest beneficiary due to its graphics processing units, or GPUs, powering the AI boom. The company surpassed $3 trillion in market cap and briefly passed Microsoft and Apple to become the world's most valuable company. Its market cap now sits below $2.5 trillion.\nSome analysts have been sounding the alarm of late regarding a potential overinvestment in AI.\nA widely read Goldman Sachs note from June warned that the biggest-spending companies had little to show for their AI expenditures. Elliott Management, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, reportedly told clients that Nvidia was in a \"bubble\" and the AI frenzy was \"overhyped.\"\nNvidia reports earnings later this month. The company has generated revenue growth in excess of 200% for the past three quarters.\n\ntitle3:\nLucid pumps $1.5B from Saudi wealth fund after CEO warned relying on its 'bottomless wealth' was 'dangerous'\ndescription3:\nSaudi Arabia is committing even more money to Lucid Motors as the EV startup struggles to erase its losses. Lucid announced Monday as part of its second-quarter earnings report that an affiliate of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is committing another $1.5 billion, with half coming in the form of a private placement and the other half as a loan facility.\nThe deal also further deepens the ties between Lucid and its majority owner, which has already committed to buying at least 50,000 of its EVs in the coming years, and is helping the company build a brand new factory in the Kingdom.\nIt\u2019s the second time Lucid has turned to Saudi Arabia for more money since Lucid\u2019s CEO Peter Rawlinson told the Financial Times in a March 2024 interview that he was wary of being over-reliant on the Kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. \u201cIf I adopt a mindset that there is bottomless wealth from PIF, that is very dangerous, that is something I will never do, I respect them far too much for that,\u201d he told the financial outlet.\nThe new funding comes as Lucid announced it lost $643 million in the second quarter of 2024, despite setting a new sales record for its electric luxury sedans that generated $200 million of revenue. Lucid reported it had $1.35 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.\nRawlinson described the injection of capital as a \u201cresounding further endorsement\u201d of Saudi Arabia\u2019s long-term commitment in Lucid.\n\u201cWe are so aligned, this transcends a mere financial arrangement,\u201d Rawlinson said during the company\u2019s earnings call Monday. \u201cWe are a cornerstone of the Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious Vision 2030 to transition their company to add to a sustainable economy, and we are proud to participate in this.\u201d\nHe also pushed back on the idea that Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest was waning. \u201cIt\u2019s often portrayed, how long is it before Saudi is going to get fed up with Peter playing with his cars?\u201d he mused. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, you know, we have regular dialogue. I have with my chairman [Turqi Alnowaiser] and we are absolutely both committed. You know, the dialogue is much more of \u2018Peter keeps things on track. We want this midsize, we want these products. Is Gravity on track?\u2019\u201d\nWhile Lucid\u2019s total second-quarter revenue figures show year-over-year growth \u2014 on both a quarter and six-month time frame \u2014 a deeper dive into the result reveals Saudi Arabia\u2019s influence.\nOn a regional basis, Lucid generated $155 million in North American sales in the second quarter, a 12% increase from the same period last year. Revenue from North American sales fell, however, when comparing results from the first six months of the year. Lucid reported $269.8 million in revenue from North America sales in the first six months of the year, a 5.7% decrease from the $286.2 million from the same six-month period in 2023.\nSales in Saudi Arabia is what helped close that gap. Revenue from sales in Saudi Arabia skyrocketed 14-fold to $95.2 million in the first six months of 2024 from the same period last year.\nLucid doesn\u2019t just need money to staunch the bleeding as it tries to carve out a market for its luxury sedan, the Air. It also needs capital to help with the upcoming launch of its first electric SUV, known as Gravity. Lucid has said the Gravity will enter production by the end of 2024 and has put its hopes on it becoming a success in North America given the popularity of the form factor in the region. The company laid off about 400 employees, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in May 2024 as part of a restructuring ahead of the launch of the Gravity SUV.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI co-founder Schulman leaves for Anthropic, Brockman takes extended leave\ndescription4:\nJohn Schulman, one of the co-founders of OpenAI, has left the company for rival AI startup Anthropic.\nIn addition, OpenAI president Greg Brockman is taking an extended leave \u2014 through the end of the year \u2014 after nine years at the company to \u201crelax and recharge,\u201d the company confirmed.\nI\u2019m taking a sabbatical through end of year. First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build. \u2014 Greg Brockman (@gdb) August 6, 2024\nPeter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year after leading products at Meta, Uber, and Airtable, also exited some time ago, the company confirmed. The news of Brockman\u2019s and Deng\u2019s departures was earlier reported by The Information.\nA spokesperson shared this statement about Schulman: \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for John\u2019s contributions as a founding team member at OpenAI and his dedicated efforts in advancing alignment research. His passion and hard work have established a strong foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and the broader field.\u201d\nSchulman posted about the decision on X today, saying that it stemmed from a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment \u2014 the science of ensuring AI behaves as intended \u2014 and engage in more hands-on technical work.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I\u2019m most interested in,\u201d Schulman said. \u201cI am confident that OpenAI and the teams I was part of will continue to thrive without me.\u201d\nSchulman\u2019s involvement with OpenAI began shortly after he completed a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. He played a pivotal role in creating the AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT by leading OpenAI\u2019s reinforcement training org, which fine-tunes generative AI models to follow human instructions.\nFollowing the departure of AI safety researcher Jan Leike (who also now works at Anthropic), Schulman became the head of OpenAI\u2019s alignment science efforts, also known as the \u201cpost-training\u201d team. He was also a member of OpenAI\u2019s recently formed safety committee; it\u2019s unclear who might replace Schulman in that role.\nDespite the controversies swirling around OpenAI, particularly with regard to the company\u2019s approach to and treatment of AI safety research, Schulman said that he wasn\u2019t leaving OpenAI due to a lack of support.\n\u201cCompany leaders have been very committed to investment in [alignment research],\u201d Schulman said. \u201cMy decision is a personal one, based on how I want to focus my efforts in the next phase of my career.\u201d\nWith Schulman\u2019s departure, only three of OpenAI\u2019s 11 original founders remain: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Brockman and Wojciech Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.\n\u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done for OpenAI!\u201d wrote Altman on a post on X.\u201d You are a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and mostly, you are a great friend to all of us.
