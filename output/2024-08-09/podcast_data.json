Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

And he has violated [the rules], by inciting hatred, fascism, civil war, death and confrontations among Venezuelans, [he] has violated all of the laws of Venezuela. And in Venezuela there are laws ... and we will enforce the laws.\nVenezuela's National Commission of Telecommunications, or Conatel, will \"remove the X social network, previously known as Twitter, out of circulation in Venezuela for 10 days,\" allowing X to respond, Maduro added.\nInternet monitoring firm NetBlocks confirmed that X is now restricted in Venezuela following Maduro's order.\nSeveral of the country's internet service providers were shown cutting off access to the site, with some displaying zero reachability and others showing restricted access, according to a post from NetBlocks on X.\n\ntitle1:\nElizabeth Warren letter to Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm about Musk\ndescription1:\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is asking the Tesla board if it's looked into CEO Elon Musk's use of company resources to benefit his other ventures, including SpaceX and xAI.\n\"Tesla's Board of Directors appears to be failing to meet its fiduciary duties to Tesla's shareholders by neglecting to address company CEO Elon Musk's apparent conflicts of interest,\" Warren wrote in a 10-page letter to Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm on Thursday. Musk also operates Neuralink and The Boring Co.\nWarren sits on both the Senate's Banking and Armed Services committees, and has expressed similar concerns in the past, including requests to the SEC to investigate Musk and Tesla. She also sent correspondence to Denholm in late 2022 after Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla shares in part to finance a leveraged buyout of Twitter, which he later rebranded X.\nMusk has targeted Warren with criticism for years. He's been referring to her as \"Senator Karen\" since at least 2021, and bristled at her calls to increase taxes for the very wealthy, to close tax loopholes for corporations and billionaires, and to crack down on corporate \"greedflation.\"\nThe concerns Warren listed in the letter include Musk's forming an artificial intelligence startup, xAI, outside of Tesla even as the automaker bills itself as an AI company, his threats to work on robotics and AI outside of Tesla if he didn't receive a higher level of voting control at the automaker, his encouraging Tesla shareholders to approve a $5 billion investment by Tesla into xAI, and his redirecting a shipment of costly Nvidia AI chips to X that were originally slated for Tesla.\nWarren's letter comes two months after CNBC reported that correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicated that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to X. Warren is also asking about xAI's poaching of employees from Tesla, and the departure of a director from Tesla reportedly because the board operated \"like a family company with fiefdoms, rather than a public company with stringent rules and regulations.\"\nWarren has asked Denholm and Tesla to provide answers to the questions concerning the board's oversight of Musk and the \"entanglements\" between his various businesses by Aug. 23.\nA spokesperson for the senator's office confirmed that Tesla and Denholm have never answered Warren's previous letters. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.\nRead the full letter here:\n\ntitle2:\nBitcoin plunged 28%. Institutional investors bought the dip\ndescription2:\nIn this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nwatch now\nThe crypto markets appear calm heading into the weekend after a volatile week that tested how institutional investors new to the crypto trade would react to the mammoth swings that are old hat for more seasoned digital currency investors. The sell-off in bitcoin and ether began earlier this week and wiped out $367 billion in value just as markets in Japan were nosediving. But it turns out, these newbie crypto traders were down to buy the dip. Spot ether exchange-traded funds collectively saw net inflows of around $120 million this week, with most traders buying in on Monday and Tuesday when the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was down 42% from its March price high of more than $4,000. Though net flows for the spot bitcoin ETFs are negative since Monday, data from crypto analytics firm CoinGlass shows demand began to reaccelerate midweek, with the batch of spot funds adding more than $245 million on Wednesday and Thursday.\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin and Ether, 1 month\nHundreds of millions of dollars began flowing into the spot bitcoin ETFs on the same day Morgan Stanley gave the green light to its 15,000 financial advisors to start pitching clients with a net worth north of $1.5 million on the funds issued by BlackRock and Fidelity. The bank, which is one of the world's largest wealth management firms, is the first among the big players on Wall Street to take this step. Up to this point, wealth management businesses have only facilitated trades if customers specifically requested exposure to these new spot crypto funds. Of Morgan Stanley's $1.5 trillion in assets under management, the bank disclosed in a May 13F filing that it held around $270 million in spot bitcoin ETFs. The next filing deadline on Wednesday will offer the latest read on how much exposure banks and hedge funds now have to these spot crypto products. The expectation is that other wirehouses and asset managers, who have been on the sidelines performing in-house due diligence on spot crypto ETFs, might feel the pressure to soon follow Morgan Stanley's lead. The spot ether ETFs, which launched less than three weeks ago, have seen relatively tepid flows compared to the blockbuster launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January. The bitcoin funds collectively hold $54.30 billion in assets under management, versus $7.25 billion across the spot ether funds.\nwatch now\nMoving in lockstep with U.S. stocks\nThe crypto market traded in lockstep with U.S. equities most of the week. The market cap of all tokens has gained back hundreds of billions of dollars since Monday and is now above $2.1 trillion. Bitcoin hit an intraday high of nearly $63,000 on Friday, and ether was trading above $2,700 earlier. More than $100 million in short bets on bitcoin was liquidated in the past 24 hours, helping to support bitcoin's gains. Though bitcoin and ether are considerably higher than the intraday lows of Monday, both assets are still down over the past seven days, with ether on pace for its worst week in nearly two years.\nwatch now\n\ntitle4:\nChina\u2019s autonomous vehicle startup WeRide prepares for a US IPO\ndescription4:\nWeRide, a Chinese autonomous vehicle company, is officially gearing up for a U.S. public debut, over a year after China started easing its effective ban of foreign IPOs.\nWeRide registered 1 billion American Depository Receipts (ADRs) at a maximum price of $0.05, with the aggregate offering coming in at $50 million, per a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nADRs represent shares in a foreign company that are traded on U.S. stock exchanges, and offering them is a strong indication that WeRide is ready for a U.S. IPO.\nThe filing comes after Bloomberg reported that WeRide is seeking up to $400 million in its IPO and private placement, citing sources familiar with the matter. About $100 million of that would come from the IPO and around $200 million to $300 million in the placement. If Bloomberg\u2019s sources are correct, that means the $50 million of ADSs could represent a portion of the IPO, or WeRide could be issuing more shares at a later date.\nWeRide did not respond in time to comment.\nIf and when WeRide goes public, this will be the largest IPO by a Chinese company on the U.S. stock market since Geely-owned luxury EV startup Zeekr began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange in May. Zeekr\u2019s stock has fallen 48% since its debut.\nWeRide initially filed confidentially to go public in the U.S. in March 2023. The AV company has raised a total of $1.39 billion at a $5.11 billion valuation, per PitchBook data. But WeRide hasn\u2019t raised a private round since 2022, and VCs have pulled back from writing large checks for autonomous vehicle companies with long roads to profitability. If WeRide hopes to scale and stay competitive, it\u2019ll need to access the public markets.\nThe company holds permits to operate autonomously in China, the UAE and Singapore. It also has permits to test with a driver and without a driver in California, and is actively testing in San Jose. Aside from a publicly accessible robotaxi operation, WeRide is working on a driverless robobus, robovan (for goods delivery) and robosweeper. The company also offers advanced driver assistance systems and plans to sell them to OEMs.\nWeRide\u2019s revenue for the first six months of 2024 was $20.7 million, which is lower than the first half of 2023\u2019s revenue of about $25.5 million, according to a regulatory filing. That\u2019s on a loss of $121.3 million for the first half of 2024, and of $100.9 million in the first half of 2023.\nWeRide isn\u2019t the only Chinese AV company that\u2019s looking to try its luck on the U.S. markets. Pony.ai, one of its main competitors, is also reportedly preparing for a U.S. IPO again, after its previous efforts fell apart in 2021. Pony was eyeing a public debut at a $12 billion valuation through a SPAC merger, but put it on hold as it struggled to gain assurances from Beijing that it wouldn\u2019t become a target of a crackdown against Chinese firms going public on foreign exchanges.\"\n\nResponse:",
