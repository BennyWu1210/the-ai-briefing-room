 Alphabet issues first-ever dividend, $70 billion buyback
Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court on October 30, 2023 in Washington, DC. Pichai testified on Monday to defend his company in the largest antitrust case since the 1990s.
Alphabet said Thursday that it's issuing a 20-cent per share dividend, the company's first ever, and that its board authorized the repurchase of up to $70 billion in stock.
The company's move comes after Meta's board authorized its first ever dividend in February. Google's parent company had $108 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand as of March 31, 2024.
Shares shot up 15% in after hours trading. The news was announced alongside better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.
Alphabet authorized an identically sized repurchase exactly one year ago, during a period of intense cost-cutting and layoffs.
The dividend is payable to all class of shares, including super-voting Class B shareholders, as well as nonvoting Class C shareholders. Most Google investors own the company through Class A shares. All shareholders of record as of June 10 will receive the dividend the same month.
Co-founder Sergey Brin, who owns more than 730 million Class B and C shares, will receive a $146 million payout. Co-founder Larry Page, who owns 389 million Class B shares, will get a dividend payment of $78 million.
Investors have been looking for signs of maturity from technology firms. Every major tech firm announced layoffs and tightened spending beginning in 2022. Investors rewarded those efforts, and have shown a similar reaction to share buybacks and dividend initiations. When Meta announced its first ever dividend in February, it helped send shares soaring more than 14%.
Notably, Amazon has never issued a dividend, nor has it ever authorized a share buyback close to the size of Google's. Amazon's largest share repurchase, in 2022, was for up to $10 billion.
Amazon is slated to report first-quarter earnings Tuesday.

Microsoft (MSFT) Q3 earnings 2024
Microsoft shares rose as much as 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the software maker issued fiscal third-quarter results that outdid Wall Street's expectations.
Here's how the company did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG:
Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected
$2.94 vs. $2.82 expected Revenue: $61.86 vs. $60.80 billion expected
Microsoft's total revenue grew 17% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.94 billion, or $2.94 per share, was up from $18.30 billion, or $2.45 per share in the year-ago quarter.
With respect to guidance, Microsoft's finance chief, Amy Hood, called for $64 billion in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, below the $64.5 billion LSEG consensus. Hood's forecast implies an operating margin of 42.3%, ahead of the StreetAccount consensus of 41.5%.
"Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity," Hood said. Microsoft has been increasing its capital expenditures to secure Nvidia graphics processing units for training and running artificial intelligence models.
During the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, including the Azure public cloud, Windows Server, Nuance and GitHub, generated $26.71 billion in revenue. That's up about 21% and more than the $26.26 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.
Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 31%, compared with 30% in the previous quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 28.8%, while the StreetAccount consensus was 28.6%.
Inside of the Azure growth, 7 percentage points were related to AI, up from 6 points of impact in the previous quarter. Microsoft provides cloud services for the ChatGPT chatbot from startup OpenAI, and companies have been increasingly adopting Azure AI services to develop their own capabilities for summarizing information and writing documents.
The capacity bottleneck cut into the AI portion of Azure growth, Hood said.
Microsoft's GitHub Copilot code-generation tool now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, CEO Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts.

FCC officially votes to reinstate net neutrality
The Federal Communications Commission made its official vote Thursday to reinstate net neutrality, which bars broadband providers from slowing or even blocking internet traffic to some sites while improving access to others that pay extra fees. With some changes and protections, passing the order titled Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet restores rules passed back during the Obama administration in 2015 and rolled back in 2017, after Donald Trump was elected president.
Since the FCC announced in September that it would be pursuing this as a policy goal, it was more or less a fait accompli; there was no real reason why the Commission, split 3-2 in favor of the Democrats, would vote against it. So though important, Thursday’s development is just another milestone on the road forward.
Opponents of the move trotted out the same old canards from 10 years ago: net neutrality equals heavy-handed regulation, rate control, the smothering of innovation — general arguments that never really had much weight. As Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel points out, the FCC already exerts rules with this authority (like with Title II, for those of you who’ve been with us from the start) in other areas, and they aren’t overcome with Draconian rules and limits.
Instead, she points out senseless inconsistencies with the last few years of operation. For instance, last year the FCC stripped some wireless providers affiliated with Chinese state actors of their ability to operate in the U.S. “But it is important to understand that our actions did not extend to broadband, thanks to the work of the last FCC,” she said in remarks at the meeting on Thursday.
Said Rosenworcel: “Our national security authorities are on record detailing how state-affiliated Chinese carriers and others have exploited insecure internet routing protocols to hijack our internet traffic. When we were asked to do something about it, thanks to the last FCC stepping out of the broadband fray, the best we could offer was a forum in the Commission Meeting Room. I don’t think that deters our adversaries.”
It’s not just the U.S. playing cloak-and-dagger with China, though. Domestic issues exist as well for them to solve: The FCC recently redefined broadband as being 100 megabits up and 25 down. I got an email from Xfinity the morning that change took effect, telling me my speeds had been magically updated at no cost to me. Generous, right? Of course, if the FCC hadn’t done that, I would have just paid more and more for the lowest speed it felt it could get away with.
Same with zero rating, where an internet provider doesn’t count certain services, like a streaming platform it owns or has a partnership with, toward your bandwidth cap. If these aren’t nipped in the bud, you end up with a bunch of awful bundles between sweetheart corporations — and with a huge proportion of TV now going over streaming, that’s more important than ever on home broadband. What’s standing between you and a Cox Gigabit Plus exclusive on the next season of “Bridgerton”? The FCC, now.
Rosenworcel summed it up best: “I think in a modern digital economy we should have a national net neutrality policy and make clear the nation’s expert on communications has the ability to act when it comes to broadband.” That’s really all there is to it.
Wondering why it took so long? Republicans in the Senate blocked the nomination of a fifth Commissioner for years, preventing the agency from doing any real work. When Anna Gomez was finally confirmed, the net neutrality proposal appeared in weeks.
Of course, as I pointed out recently, the new net neutrality rules are far from secure. They will need to weather challenges in court, and depending on the outcome of the election they could simply be rolled back or legislated away. On the other hand, under a friendly administration, these rules could be enshrined in law during the next term.
Rosenworcel specifically called out California’s own state net neutrality rules as an example of what happens if federal authorities can’t be relied on. Though she is clearly grateful for California’s legislative stand, there may be matters to work out where the two rules contradict one another. But establishing a national rule as a base level for protections, as we do in so many other industries, seems like the bare minimum.
It will be some time before the rules take effect, as they have to be published in the Federal Register first, and then there is another waiting period. But you probably won’t even notice when they do. The companies that would have, and occasionally did, attempt to interfere with broadband traffic soon found that it wasn’t worth the risk due to consumer backlash and eventually federal protections. They’ve been more or less on their best behavior, knowing that this rule was likely coming. Plus it gave them the excuse to say, “anti-consumer practices, what anti-consumer practices? We haven’t done anything like that for years!” Don’t believe them.
If you’re still curious about what the new rule concerns, there’s a nice informative page here (I learned things) and a video where Chairwoman Rosenworcel breaks it down.

Health insurance giant Kaiser will notify millions of a data breach after sharing patients' data with advertisers
U.S. health conglomerate Kaiser is notifying millions of current and former members of a data breach after confirming it shared patients’ information with third-party advertisers, including Google, Microsoft and X (formerly Twitter).
In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Kaiser said that it conducted an investigation that found “certain online technologies, previously installed on its websites and mobile applications, may have transmitted personal information to third-party vendors.”
Kaiser said that the data shared with advertisers includes member names and IP addresses, as well as information that could indicate if members were signed into a Kaiser Permanente account or service and how members “interacted with and navigated through the website and mobile applications, and search terms used in the health encyclopedia.”
Kaiser said it subsequently removed the tracking code from its websites and mobile apps.
Kaiser is the latest healthcare organization to confirm it shared patients’ personal information with third-party advertisers by way of online tracking code, often embedded in web pages and mobile apps and designed to collect information about users’ online activity for analytics. Over the past year, telehealth startups Cerebral, Monument and Tempest have pulled tracking code from their apps that shared patients’ personal and health information with advertisers.
Kaiser spokesperson Diana Yee said that the organization would begin notifying 13.4 million affected current and former members and patients who accessed its websites and mobile apps. The notifications will start in May in all markets where Kaiser Permanente operates, the spokesperson said.
The health giant also filed a legally required notice with the U.S. government on April 12 but made public on Thursday confirming that 13.4 million residents had information exposed.
U.S. organizations covered under the health privacy law known as HIPAA are required to notify the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of data breaches involving protected health information, such as medical data and patient records. Kaiser also notified California’s attorney general of the data breach, but did not provide any further details.
The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan is the parent organization of several entities that make up Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest healthcare organizations in the United States. The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan provides health insurance plans to employers and reported 12.5 million members as of the end of 2023.
The breach at Kaiser is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services’ website as the largest confirmed health-related data breach of 2024 so far.

Boeing's Starliner set to fly astronauts for the first time on May 6
Boeing’s Starliner set to fly astronauts for the first time on May 6
Boeing’s Starliner is a go for launch.
Leaders from NASA and Boeing told reporters that the first crewed Starliner mission, which will see the capsule carry two astronauts to the International Space Station, is moving ahead toward its historic May 6 launch date.
NASA and Boeing concluded that the capsule is ready for launch after completing a critical flight test review on Thursday. Barring no issues, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will board Starliner on the evening of May 6 and take their ride on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to space.
Around 24 hours later, the two astronauts will arrive at the ISS, where they’ll stay for about a week. Starliner will stay docked with the station; the duo will use it to return to Earth. A total of five parachutes will slow Starliner from ultra-fast orbital speeds to enable a soft landing somewhere in the western U.S.
This will mark Starliner’s second flight to the ISS: The first, an uncrewed mission called Orbital Flight Test-2, took place in May 2022. If Boeing and NASA are unable to meet the May 6 date, there are additional launch opportunities on May 7, 10 and 11.
The significance of the mission cannot be understated. NASA established the Commercial Crew Program (CCP) in 2011 to purchase astronaut transportation services from private industry; the agency selected SpaceX and NASA under a multibillion-dollar deal. But as opposed to SpaceX, which has completed all six missions under the original contract plus more, Boeing’s Starliner has been badly delayed by numerous technical issues.
Boeing has been hit by over $1.5 billion in overrun costs due to those delays. The aerospace giant has been affected by a slew of other near-catastrophes as of late, with the company facing regulatory scrutiny due to screwups in its commercial airplane unit. Earlier this year, it was announced that Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun would step down at the end of 2024.
For NASA, a new spacecraft means doubling America’s astronaut transportation resources and introducing a much-needed degree of redundancy to the agency’s human spaceflight program. If Boeing nails this test, Starliner will achieve its final certification and can begin regular missions under the CCP contract.
NASA determined that the probability of loss-of-crew with this Starliner mission is 1-in-295, which is above NASA’s required 1-in-270 odds. (A NASA representative did not have equivalent data for SpaceX’s Crew Dragon.)
“The lives of our crew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake,” NASA’s associate administrator, Jim Free, said. “We don’t take that lightly at all.”
