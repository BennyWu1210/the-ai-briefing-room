Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday September 10), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAirPods 4 announced\ndescription0:\nApple just unveiled the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which join the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus the company announced earlier. These are Apple's more premium phones that have nicer screens and cameras than the regular models.\nApple's iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, and the Apple 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display, larger than those of previous models, which measured in at 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively. The new models also have the \"thinnest borders on any Apple product,\" Apple said, calling them \"by far our best iPhone displays ever.\" The titanium is nearly half the weight of stainless steel and is \"more scratch resistant than other forms of titanium others have used.\"\nThe four finishes include white, black, natural and \"desert.\"\nThe company also said the new iPhone 16 Pro Max has \"the best iPhone battery life ever\" but did not offer additional details.\nThe new iPhone Pro models include an A18 Pro chip with second-generation 3-nanometer transistors and a new 16-core neural engine that powers Apple Intelligence, designed specifically for generative artificial intelligence workloads, the company said, leading to a 17% increase in total system memory bandwidth. It is \"even faster and more efficient than A18,\" the company said.\nThe A18 Pro chip also powers new camera features, per Apple, including a new 48-megapixel \"fusion camera,\" which can read data 2x faster, and a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera that allows for more detail in wide-angle shots. The 5x telephoto camera offers more detail for zoom photos.\nApple also introduced video capture in 4K at 120 frames per second, the iPhone camera's \"highest resolution and frame rate yet.\"\nThe Pro models have four \"studio-quality\" mics with reduced noise, designed in part for vocal and acoustic recordings, the company said, as well as spatial audio capture. A new \"Audio Mix\" feature, which Apple called an \"industry first,\" uses machine learning to identify and separate background elements from a user's speech, the company said.\nApple said a new update to Voice Memos, coming \"later this year,\" will allow people to layer other tracks atop previously recorded voice memos. For example, the feature could help musicians testing out song ideas layer a guitar track over a vocal track they have previously recorded.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, and the Pro Max starts at $1,199, Apple said. Both models will be available for preorder on Friday, with in-store sales starting on Sept. 20.\n\u2014 Hayden Field\n\ntitle1:\nPalantir soars 14% on software vendor's inclusion in S&P 500\ndescription1:\nAlex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, walks to the morning session at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 10, 2024.\nPalantir shares popped 14% on Monday and are trading at their highest since early 2021 after the announcement late Friday that the stock is being added to the S&P 500.\nPalantir is joining the index along with Dell . Palantir and Dell are replacing American Airlines and Etsy , respectively, S&P Global said in a press release.\nShares of companies added to the benchmark often rally after the announcement because fund managers who track the index regularly update their portfolios to mirror the additions. Dell shares rose almost 4% on Monday.\nTo join the S&P 500, a company must have reported a profit in its latest quarter and have cumulative profit over the four most-recent quarters. In the second quarter, Palantir's net income totaled $135.6 million, up from $27.9 million in the same period a year earlier. The company turned profitable in the final quarter of 2022.\nTech companies have been capturing a bigger share of the S&P 500, reflecting their growing significance to the broader economy. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike was added to the index during the previous rebalancing in June. Super Micro Computer, which competes with Dell in selling servers for artificial intelligence workloads, joined three months before that.\nThe median market cap of companies in the S&P 500 is about $33.5 billion. Palantir has a market cap of more than $76 billion. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. Its stock hit a closing high of $39 in January 2021.\nThe shares closed at $34.60 on Monday, about 11% shy of its high.\n\u2014 CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.\n\ntitle2:\nOnline, led by social media, overtakes TV as the most popular source of news in the UK, Ofcom says\ndescription2:\nThe newspaper business has been in the middle of a long and slow decline thanks to the rise of the internet. Now some new research out of the U.K. lays bare how TV news is facing a similar fate.\nOnline platforms have now overtaken TV for the first time as the most popular resource for news among adult consumers, at 71% versus 70%, according to new research from U.K. communications regulator Ofcom.\nThis is a significant shift. Not only has TV dominated news for more than 60 years (a period when it overtook newspapers in popularity for news; that was the first blow for broadsheets), but also as online platforms replace broadcasters (and newspapers), the news they carry comes from a much wider set of sources. That\u2019s both a blessing for having more viewpoints and a curse for being significantly harder to vet for accuracy \u2014 and consumers are concerned that this will only get worse with the growth of AI.\nOfcom\u2019s larger conclusions may not be a surprise: Newspapers have been in trouble for decades; TV has faced pressure from streaming and online media in other categories like entertainment for years; and AI has a lot to answer for in areas like deepfakes and misinformation. But the research is significant because it gives statistics to how usage is shifting, and Ofcom said it will use the conclusions to help determine what to focus its regulation on in the years ahead.\n\u201cTelevision has dominated people\u2019s news habits since the \u201960s, and it still commands really high trust,\u201d said Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u2019s group director for strategy and research, in a statement. \u201cBut we\u2019re witnessing a generational shift to online news, which is often seen as less reliable \u2014 together with growing fears about misinformation and deepfake content. Ofcom wants to secure high-quality news for the next generation, so we\u2019re kicking off a review of the public service media that help underpin the U.K.\u2019s democracy and public debate.\u201d\nOfcom has been running annual surveys on news consumption since 2017. This year it canvassed over 5,000 adults both online and face-to-face.\nFace the news\nEven as online news as a broader category continues to have a disruptive force in the media market, getting online if you\u2019re a publisher is not exactly a panacea. Online news outlets are also seeing their audiences get eroded by newer kids on the block: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and X/Twitter all make the list of top 10 news sources in the survey.\nImage Credits: Ofcom\nSome of this is a little ironic. There\u2019s been a rising controversy of fake news created and disseminated on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, X/Twitter and more over the last decade, and regulators and lawmakers have definitely taken notice. At the same time, and perhaps related to that heat, Facebook has moved to de-emphasize news on its platform, killing its own Facebook News effort earlier this year.\nYet news continues to be the powerful heartbeat of how people engage on these platforms. Some 30% of respondents said that they got their news from Facebook, putting it on par with the broadcaster ITV. Google-owned YouTube saw its share spike 12 percentage points to 19%.\nTikTok did not make it into the top 10 \u2014 yet? \u2014 but it\u2019s growing fast. Around 11% of adults said that it\u2019s a source for news, compared to just 1% in 2020.\nUsers between the ages of 12 and 15 have embraced news on TikTok in a big way. The ByteDance-owned short video platform was named by 30% of younger respondents as their go-to for news, with 12% describing it as their main source of news.\nSome 27% said they used YouTube for news, while Facebook and Instagram each registered with 21% of respondents. Snapchat and WhatsApp came in at 16%, with X/Twitter at 10%. (Interestingly, BBC continues to be a source, too: 36% said that they continue to use it for news, but it\u2019s the only one that stood out.)\nThe U.K. findings appear to largely mirror trends that are playing out in the U.S. Pew Research earlier this year found that about half of TikTok\u2019s users under the age of 30 are getting politics and news content from the video app.\nDon\u2019t trust the process\nThat trend should not be received without alarm bells. The rise of internet and user-generated content go hand in hand with a faster and looser idea of what constitutes news \u2014 and how that can be exploited.\nElection cycles continue to be the most acute examples of that. During the U.K. General Election earlier this year, Ofcom said that 60% of respondents in its survey recalled seeing false or misleading information, with 10% saying they saw this kind of content \u201cseveral times a day.\u201d\nOn top of that, 57% of respondents said they were worried about getting conned by deepfake content, with 27% saying they had already encountered some.\nTo be fair, as you can see from the table below, TV, newspapers and radio all still have a lot to do to gain more trust from consumers, too. The bigger effort should be to ensure that news does not simply become a race to the bottom.\n\ntitle3:\nApple's iPhone 16 Pro models arrive with 6.3- and 6.9-inch displays, larger battery and new A18 Pro chip\ndescription3:\nApple revealed the full iPhone 16 line at Monday\u2019s \u201cGlowtime\u201d event. According to CEO Tim Cook, the new handsets are \u201cbuilt around Apple Intelligence from the ground up.\u201d Along with the base-level models, the company debuted the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, which both feature the new A18 Chip.\nThe Pro Displays are now available in 6.3- and 6.9-inch displays. The body is made of grade five titanium, available in four different colors. As with the 16, the battery size has increased, with the Max model sporting the line\u2019s longest-ever life, according to the company.\nImage Credits: Apple\nThe A18 Pro has a 16-core CPU, while the new GPU offers 2x faster ray tracing in games, according to the company. Apple says the chip is also more power efficient than last year\u2019s model, while offering faster data transfer speeds via USB.\nAs with the 16, the new Pro models feature a devoted camera button. The camera array has been updated as well, with significantly faster shutter speeds. The main and ultra-wide cameras are 48 megapixels. The latter can shoot micro images, while the third camera \u2014 a telephoto \u2014 offers 5x \u201coptical quality\u201d telephoto shots.\nThe camera control has been upgraded as well, with new \u201cpro\u201d features that offer improved control over things like color grading. The phone can shoot 4K video at 120 frames a second. This allows for improved slow-motion shooting; notably the playback speed can be toggled after the video is shot.\nUsers can also capture Spatial Audio while shooting video; the sound quality is improved via \u201cstudio quality\u201d microphones. Users can switch between audio mixes after capture, which means you can, say, isolate in-frame audio while drowning out ambient noise.\nAn update to Voice Memos makes it possible to layer tracks. In the example given, a user sings over a music track as it plays back through the speakers. When played back, the instrumental track is removed and the voice isolated.\nThe 16 Pro starts at $999, while the Pro Max runs $1,119 and up. Preorder opens Friday. The handsets start shipping on September 20.\n\ntitle4:\nAMD is turning its back on flagship gaming GPUs - to chase AI first\ndescription4:\nTom\u2019s Hardware: Price point-wise, you have leadership, but you won\u2019t go after the flagship market?\nJack Huynh: One day, we may. But my priority right now is to build scale for AMD. Because without scale right now, I can\u2019t get the developers. If I tell developers, \u2018I\u2019m just going for 10 percent of the market share,\u2019 they just say, \u2018Jack, I wish you well, but we have to go with Nvidia.\u2019 So, I have to show them a plan that says, \u2018Hey, we can get to 40% market share with this strategy.\u2019 Then they say, \u2018I\u2019m with you now, Jack. Now I\u2019ll optimize on AMD.\u2019 Once we get that, then we can go after the top.\"\n\nResponse:",
