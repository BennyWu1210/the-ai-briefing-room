Script:
i'm cara stevens, and this is your cnbc tech check briefing. in the race to electrify america's highways, tesla refuses to park its ambitions, pressing ahead to establish a groundbreaking 1,800-mile electric charging corridor from texas to california. this initiative, ripe with potential to revolutionize the heavy-duty trucking industry, steers clear of relying on president biden's bipartisan infrastructure law for funding, following a notable omission of tesla from a list of projects granted a slice of a $623 million pie. despite this setback, tesla, undeterred, is exploring state funding avenues and is open to future rounds of federal assistance, according to sources close to the company.

in cybersecurity news, a massive data breach has put a spotlight on the shadowy world of financial crime watchlists. hackers, identifying as ghostr, have reportedly pilfered 5.3 million records from the world-check database, a critical tool in the global fight against financial crime, used to screen against sanctions and money laundering risks. if the threat to publish the stolen data comes to fruition, the ramifications could be unprecedented, raising questions about the security of 'know your customer' protocols and the safeguarding of sensitive information in an increasingly interconnected financial sphere.

switching gears to social media, meta is betting big on ai, unveiling its meta ai assistant across whatsapp, instagram, facebook, and messenger. as mark zuckerberg touts the assistant as a game-changer, powered by meta's latest large language model, meta llama 3, the company positions itself as a pivotal player in the booming ai landscape. this expansive rollout represents meta's largest foray into ai, promising an intuitive, multi-platform assistant capable of generating images, animations, and answering user queries with unprecedented ease.

on the entertainment front, amazon's recent venture into the dystopian world of fallout has quickly paid dividends, securing a swift renewal for a second season. riding high on what amazon describes as a historic debut, the live-action series cements its place among the streaming giant's most successful titles, sharing rarified air with the likes of 'rings of power.' the announcement has stoked anticipation among fans eager to see how the fallout universe will expand in its sophomore season.

lastly, netflix has made headlines, confirming that its hit series 'the witcher' will conclude with its fifth season. as liam hemsworth prepares to don the iconic white wig of geralt of rivia, taking over from henry cavill, fans are left wondering how the sprawling saga will draw to a close. with production on the horizon, the final chapters promise to bring the epic journey, rooted in andrzej sapkowski‚Äôs beloved books, to a fitting end.

that's your cnbc tech check briefing for today. keep a pulse on the future, because in tech, tomorrow is always day one
