Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Soon after, Bloomberg also reported that Apple is in talks but added that Nvidia \u201chas discussed\u201d joining the funding round as well. The round is reportedly being led by Thrive Capital and would value OpenAI at more than $100 billion.\nIt\u2019s perhaps not too surprising that Apple and Nvidia might end up investing in OpenAI. Apple is set to integrate ChatGPT with Siri later this year, and it reportedly planned to have Phil Schiller join OpenAI\u2019s board before apparently abandoning that plan. And Nvidia is a key supplier to OpenAI, which relies on Nvidia\u2019s chips to help power its AI services.\nMicrosoft is also in talks to join the funding round, according to Bloomberg. The company invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and made a multibillion-dollar investment in 2023.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia (NVDA) earnings report Q2 2025\ndescription1:\nNvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.\nNvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.\nHere is how the company did for the fiscal second quarter versus LSEG consensus expectations:\nEarnings per share : 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected\n: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected Revenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected\nNvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.\nRevenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.\nNet income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\nNvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.\nRevenue in Nvidia's data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.\nNot all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the company's networking products.\nMuch of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidia's chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nMany customers are waiting for Nvidia's next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell. Nvidia said it shipped samples of Blackwell chips during the quarter, and made a change to the product to make it more efficient to manufacture.\n\"In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,\" Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a call with analysts.\n\"The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the call.\n\"When I said start production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship,\" he continued.\nHowever, Nvidia said it expected the current-generation chip, called Hopper, to increase total shipments for the next two quarters, as opposed to taper off.\n\"Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,\" said Huang in the press release. Nvidia noted that supply for Hopper is becoming more available while Blackwell is still in short supply.\nNvidia said its gross margin slipped in the quarter to 75.1% from 78.4% in the prior period, though it is still up from 70.1% a year ago. For the full year, the company said it expects gross margins to be in the \"mid-70% range.\" Analysts were expecting a full-year margin of 76.4%, according to StreetAccount.\nNvidia's gaming business used to be the company's primary focus before the data center took off. Gaming revenue increased 16% from a year ago to $2.9 billion, beating StreetAccount's estimate of $2.7 billion. The company said it was partially due to increased PC gaming card shipments as well as \"game console SOCs.\" Nvidia provides chips for Nintendo's consoles.\nNvidia also makes chips for high-end graphic designers as well as cars and robots. The company's professional visualization business rose 20% and reported $454 million in revenue. Nvidia reported $346 million in automotive and robotics revenue, versus StreetAccount expectations of $344.7 million.\nNvidia also said it approved $50 billion in additional share buybacks.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI and Anthropic agree to let U.S. AI Safety Institute test models\ndescription2:\nOpenAI and Anthropic, two of the most richly valued artificial intelligence startups, have agreed to let the U.S. AI Safety Institute test their new models before releasing them to the public, following increased concerns in the industry about safety and ethics in AI.\nThe institute, housed within the Department of Commerce at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), said in a press release that it will get \"access to major new models from each company prior to and following their public release.\"\nThe group was established after the Biden-Harris administration issued the U.S. government's first-ever executive order on artificial intelligence in October 2023, requiring new safety assessments, equity and civil rights guidance and research on AI's impact on the labor market.\n\"We are happy to have reached an agreement with the US AI Safety Institute for pre-release testing of our future models,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a post on X. OpenAI also confirmed to CNBC on Thursday that, in the past year, the company has doubled its number of weekly active users from late last year to 200 million. Axios was first to report on the number.\nThe news comes a day after reports surfaced that OpenAI is in talks to raise a funding round valuing the company at more than $100 billion. Thrive Capital is leading the round and will invest $1 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.\nAnthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees, was most recently valued at $18.4 billion. Anthropic counts Amazon as a leading investor, while OpenAI is heavily backed by Microsoft .\nThe agreements between the government, OpenAI and Anthropic \"will enable collaborative research on how to evaluate capabilities and safety risks, as well as methods to mitigate those risks,\" according to Thursday's release.\nJason Kwon, OpenAI's chief strategy officer, told CNBC in a statement that, \"We strongly support the U.S. AI Safety Institute's mission and look forward to working together to inform safety best practices and standards for AI models.\"\nJack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, said the company's \"collaboration with the U.S. AI Safety Institute leverages their wide expertise to rigorously test our models before widespread deployment\" and \"strengthens our ability to identify and mitigate risks, advancing responsible AI development.\"\nA number of AI developers and researchers have expressed concerns about safety and ethics in the increasingly for-profit AI industry. Current and former OpenAI employees published an open letter on June 4, describing potential problems with the rapid advancements taking place in AI and a lack of oversight and whistleblower protections.\n\"AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" they wrote. AI companies, they added, \"currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society,\" and they can not be \"relied upon to share it voluntarily.\"\nDays after the letter was published, a source familiar to the mater confirmed to CNBC that the FTC and the Department of Justice were set to open antitrust investigations into OpenAI, Microsoft and Nvidia. FTC Chair Lina Khan has described her agency's action as a \"market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.\"\nOn Wednesday, California lawmakers passed a hot-button AI safety bill, sending it to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk. Newsom, a Democrat, will decide to either veto the legislation or sign it into law by Sept. 30. The bill, which would make safety testing and other safeguards mandatory for AI models of a certain cost or computing power, has been contested by some tech companies for its potential to slow innovation.\nWATCH: Google, OpenAI and others oppose California AI safety bill\n\ntitle3:\nDell earnings report Q2 2025\ndescription3:\nMichael Dell at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 12, 2024 in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nDell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 3% in extended trading.\nHere's how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:\nRevenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected\n$25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected EPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected\nNet income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.\nThe stock took a leg lower after Dell revised its full-year guidance to between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion, a slight upward revision from the company's previous forecast. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.\nFor the current quarter, Dell said it expected between $24 billion and $25 billion in revenue, in line with the StreetAccount estimate of $24.6 billion.\nDell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company's new chips.\nDell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company's last report.\nAI sales are in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It's the company's fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.\nThe standout in Dell's report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It's part of ISG.\n\"We are competing in all of the big AI deals and are winning significant deployments at scale,\" Jeff operating chief Jeff Clark said on a earnings call with analysts.\nThe unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.\nClarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said that there was an increasing \"backlog\" of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven't been fulfilled yet. There's also a multibillion-dollar \"pipeline\" of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven't been finalized.\nHowever, Dell's storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.\nDell's Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company's enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.\nDell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.\n\ntitle4:\nMongoDB (MDB) Q2 earnings report 2025\ndescription4:\nMongoDB shares jumped as much as 16% in extended trading on Thursday after the database software maker reported healthy fiscal second-quarter earnings and pushed up full-year guidance.\nHere's how the company did against LSEG consensus:\nEarnings per share: 70 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected\n70 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected Revenue: $478.1 million vs. $464.1 million\nMongoDB's revenue grew 13% year over year in the quarter that ended July 31, according to a statement. The quarter's net loss came to $54.5 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $37.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\"We believe we are incredibly well positioned to help customers incorporate generative AI into their business and modernize their legacy application estate,\" CEO Dev Ittycheria said in the statement.\nThe company's Atlas cloud database service enjoyed modestly better consumption than expected, he said on a conference call with analysts.\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Atlas consumption growth slowed as clients observed more challenging economic conditions, and usage in the fiscal second quarter implied that the climate did not change, Ittycheria said.\n\"We generally have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business, and that was true in Q2 as well,\" Ittycheria said. \"We realized that this is different from what you hear from some other software vendors.\"\nOn Thursday Ash Kulkarni, CEO of search software maker Elastic , said the volume of client commitments it closed in its fiscal first quarter was below plan. That stock was down 23% after hours. During the MongoDB call, Ittycheria talked about helping companies migrate from Elastic products.\nWith respect to guidance, MongoDB called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 to 68 cents per share on $493.0 million to $497.0 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 60 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.\nManagement nudged up their fiscal 2025 forecast. MongoDB now sees $2.33 to $2.47 per share in adjusted earnings, with $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion in revenue. That's up from the May guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion in revenue.
