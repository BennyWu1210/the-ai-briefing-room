The first investigation, reported by Politico, will see the DOJ examine Nvidia\u2019s buyout of Run:ai, while the second, as reported by The Information, will assess if Nvidia abused its dominance in AI chips to discourage customers from using competing products.\nIn April, Nvidia reportedly spent $700 million to acquire Run:ai, the Israeli startup specializing in GPU management software. While specific concerns surrounding the Run:ai purchase haven\u2019t been disclosed, both US and international regulators have closely scrutinized big tech acquisitions of late over issues like anticompetitive business practices and market monopolies. AI acquisitions have been of particular interest, with a joint statement issued by major US, EU, and UK regulators in July pledging to \u201csafeguard against tactics that would undermine fair competition or lead to unfair or deceptive practices in the AI ecosystem.\u201d\nThe second investigation being launched by the DOJ comes in response to complaints from competitors. It will examine whether Nvidia abused its market dominance to pressure cloud providers into buying its products. The probe will also investigate claims that Nvidia overcharges its customers for networking equipment if they opt to purchase AI chips from rival companies like AMD and Intel.\n\u201cWe compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making Nvidia openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d Nvidia spokesperson Mylene Mangalindan said in a statement to Politico. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to support aspiring innovators in every industry and market and are happy to provide any information regulators need.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nMeta's Threads crosses 200 million active users\ndescription1:\nA day after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about his newest social media experiment Threads reaching \u201calmost\u201d 200 million users on the company\u2019s Q2 2024 earnings call, the platform has touched the milestone.\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri confirmed that the Twitter rival has reached 200 million active users in a post on Threads. Meta has taken just 13 months to achieve the figure.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to share that we crossed the 200M milestone on @threads,\u201d Mosseri wrote. \u201cMy hope is that Threads can inspire ideas that bring people together and this amazing community continues to grow.\u201d\nGrowth for Threads has been strong. The text-focused social media platform, which launched in July 2023, reached 150 million users in April 2024 and 175 million users in July on its one-year anniversary, before another growth spurt led it to hit 200 million a month later.\nFor comparison, Threads\u2019 main rival X (formerly Twitter) had more than 600 million monthly users back in May, according to owner Elon Musk. The demise of legacy Twitter under Musk\u2019s erratic change of direction \u2014 which alienated scores of long-time users \u2014 was the original impetus for Meta to launch Threads, to offer consumers an alternative space for online discussion.\nLast year, Zuckerberg suggested Threads has a \u201cgood chance\u201d of becoming a platform with more than a billion users. On the latest earnings call, the Meta CEO also described the platform as being on a good growth trajectory.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making steady progress towards building what looks like it\u2019s going to be another major social app. And we are seeing deeper engagement,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m quite pleased with the trajectory here.\u201d\nZuckerberg added that apart from shipping features, the company is working on improving Threads\u2019 content recommendation system.\n\ntitle2:\nEx-Google engineers from Character.AI rejoin company with AI partnership\ndescription2:\nFounders of one of the hottest artificial intelligence startups Character.AI are rejoining Google along with other team members.\nNoam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, in addition to certain members of Character.AI's research team, are joining Google's AI unit DeepMind, the companies said Friday.\nCharacter.AI uses large language models to allow users to create chatbots and interact with those created by other users. The startup reached a $1 billion valuation as the AI boom began last year. Character.AI did not generate revenue then but said it was considering offering a subscription service in the future.\nThe two founders left Google in 2021 after the search giant reportedly rebuffed their attempts to try and get Google to push a chatbot forward. They went on to start Character.AI that same year.\nFreitas criticized the company's slow-moving pace, telling Axios last March, \"There are some overlaps, but we're confident Google will never do anything fun,\" regarding the Bard, which is now Gemini chatbot.\nCharacter.AI will provide Google with a nonexclusive license for its current large language model, or LLM, technology, the company's blog post states. \"This agreement will provide increased funding for Character.AI to continue growing and to focus on building personalized AI products for users around the world,\" it states.\n\"Over the past two years, however, the landscape has shifted \u2014 many more pre-trained models are now available,\" the blog post continues. \"Given these changes, we see an advantage in making greater use of third-party LLMs alongside our own. This allows us to devote even more resources to post-training and creating new product experiences for our growing user base.\"\nAlphabet, facing criticism of getting beat to the AI chatbot craze by OpenAI's ChatGPT, has enacted changes to its organization to move more quickly to market. Late last year, Google was reportedly in talks to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Character.AI.\n\"I am super excited to return to Google and work as part of the Google DeepMind team,\" Shazeer said in a statement on Friday. \"I am so proud of everything we built at Character.AI over the last 3 years. I am confident that the funds from the non-exclusive Google licensing agreement together with the incredible Character.AI team positions Character.AI for continued success in the future.\"\nA Google spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC, \"We're particularly thrilled to welcome back Noam, a preeminent researcher in machine learning, who is joining Google DeepMind's research team, along with a small number of his colleagues.\"\nThe move also comes amid a competitive talent and AI landscape, leading companies to form partnerships against a tough regulatory landscape that has placed scrutiny on mergers and acquisitions. Britain's competition watchdog said earlier this week it is looking into Google's partnership with AI startup Anthropic, for example.\nIn March, Microsoft hired Mustafa Suleyman, a co-founder of AI startup DeepMind that Google acquired in 2014, and much of its staff to lead AI initiatives. Suleyman became an executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. Last month, U.K. regulators opened a merger probe on Microsoft\u2019s hiring of the staff.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon stock down after third-quarter outlook disappoints\ndescription3:\nAndy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.Com Inc., during the GeekWire Summit in Seattle, Washington, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021.\nAmazon shares closed down about 8.7% on Friday, a day after the company reported mixed second-quarter results and gave a forecast for the third quarter that fell short of Wall Street's expectations.\nRevenue in the second quarter rose 10% from a year earlier to $147.98 billion, falling just short of the $148.56 billion projected by LSEG. Net income at Amazon nearly doubled from a year earlier to $1.26 a share, topping analysts estimates of $1.03 per share and providing the latest evidence that the company's focus on cost-cutting is bolstering its bottom line.\nFor the third quarter, which runs through September, Amazon said it expects revenue of $154 billion to $158.5 billion. The midpoint of the range, $156.25 billion, fell short of consensus estimates of $158.24 billion, according to LSEG.\nThe company said it saw softer-than-anticipated sales because consumers continue to \"trade down\" to lower-ticket items, such as everyday essentials and consumables, or items that tend to be cheaper and used up on a regular basis. What's more, a chaotic news cycle means that consumers are more distracted than usual, and may wait to make a purchase or abandon their cart altogether, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.\nOlsavsky pointed to the Olympics, the ramp up to the presidential election and the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump as recent events that have distracted consumers and made it a \"tough quarter to forecast.\"\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said Friday they were less worried about the retail miss and more encouraged by continued strength in Amazon's cloud computing segment. Amazon Web Services revenue reached $26.3 billion during the quarter, topping consensus estimates of $26 billion.\n\"Sometimes Retail leads AMZN's business and other times it's AWS,\" the JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients. They have an overweight rating on the stock.\nBMO Capital Markets analysts agreed, saying they were pleased that AWS growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, demonstrating that the cost optimization seen in recent quarters is now in the rearview mirror.\n\"We believe AWS is well-positioned to benefit from a shift back to modernization, with additional benefits as new workloads are born in the cloud,\" said the analysts, who have an outperform rating on Amazon shares. \"Despite the view that Amazon is far behind in AI, we see Amazon as a key AI beneficiary, having already achieved a multi-billion dollar run-rate business in AI.\"\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2032.\n\ntitle4:\nSelf-driving truck startup Aurora Innovation raises $483M in share sale ahead of commercial launch\ndescription4:\nSelf-driving technology company Aurora Innovation was hoping to raise hundreds of millions in additional capital as it races toward a driverless commercial launch by the end of 2024. The company, which had arranged to sell up to $420 million worth of shares, exceeded its goal and raised $483 million.\nThe newly raised funds come a little over a year since Aurora completed a capital raise of $820 million from a public and concurrent private offering of its stock.\n\u201cThis raise is a testament to investors\u2019 confidence in Aurora\u2019s ability to be a company for the long term, prompted by a recent Analyst Day where investors experienced driverless truck rides, and recent milestones that underscore the strength of our partner ecosystem to deploy at scale,\u201d company spokesperson Rachel Chibidakis told TechCrunch in an email.\nAurora made its public debut through a special purpose acquisition merger in 2021, and its stock has traded as high as $13.12 on opening day. Aurora shares closed Friday at $3.84. Shares rose more than 2% in after-hours trading.\nAurora is pursuing a driver-as-a-service model, wherein carriers purchase trucks with the Aurora Driver tech on board and then offer their services via those trucks to shippers. But the company is planning to go to market as a carrier, offering up to 20 autonomous Paccar and Volvo trucks to shippers at the end of this year.\nAurora first revealed Thursday plans to sell up to $420 million worth of Class A common stock to underwriters Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company and Morgan Stanley, according to an SEC filing. The Thursday agreement came a day after Aurora filed a prospectus offering to sell $350 million worth of shares. Someone familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that due to strong investor demand, the offering had been upsized to $420 million.\nAurora expected the net proceeds from the sale to bring in about $405 million, or around $466 million \u201cif the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,\u201d after deducting the usual discounts, commissions and offering expenses, per an updated filing. The deal closed Friday afternoon pushed the raise to $483 million.\nAurora did not respond Thursday to questions about how it intends to use the net proceeds. The Thursday filing provided few hints, stating vaguely that the company will put the money toward \u201cworking capital and other general corporate purposes.\u201d The company also wrote in its filing that it\u2019ll first invest the proceeds from this offering into \u201cshort and long-term investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations.\u201d\nAurora provided more detail after the deal closed Friday.\n\u201cThis opportunistic raise gives us runway well into 2026, putting us on the path to deploy driverless trucks at scale and become a cash flow positive company, which we expect in 2028,\u201d said Chibidakis, adding that as the company approaches its planned commercial launch that enthusiasm is building. \u201cOur continued momentum and more favorable market conditions made this an opportune time to raise additional capital.\u201d\nThe bid for more funds comes as Aurora reports its second-quarter results. As of June 30, 2024, Aurora had $402 million in cash and cash equivalents and $618 million in short-term investments. Not including the proceeds from its offering, the company expects this to be enough to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\nIn Q2 2024, Aurora spent $198 million, which is a direct loss because the startup isn\u2019t yet pulling in any revenue.\nThe company is slated to start its commercial service later this year on the Uber Freight network. In June, the two companies announced a multi-year collaboration that will see Aurora\u2019s autonomous driving technology offered on the Uber Freight network through 2030.\nUpdate: This story was updated to reflect that Aurora\u2019s $618 million in short-term investments are essentially liquid.\nThis story was originally published August 1, 2024 at 9:34 am PT. It has been updated to include estimated proceeds per an additional SEC filing. The article was updated Friday at 4:31 pm PT after Aurora had announced the final raise amount.\"\n\nResponse:",
