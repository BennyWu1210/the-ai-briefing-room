Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

That easily topped consensus estimates of $65.8 billion, according to FactSet.\nShopify sells software for merchants who run online businesses as well as services such as advertising and payment processing tools. Jeff Hoffmeister, Shopify's CFO, said in a statement the company continued to \"take share\" during the quarter even as consumer spending remains in flux amid a rocky economic backdrop.\nRival e-commerce companies including Amazon , Etsy and Wayfair have all said in earnings reports in recent weeks that consumers continue to be cautious about their spending and are in some cases \"trading down\" to cheaper brands while hunting for deals.\nOn a conference call with investors, Shopify executives said its merchants have been able to navigate the consumer slowdown, a factor it attributed to the \"very diverse set\" of businesses that use its platform.\n\"I think that our merchants do seem to be, you know, outperforming and doing better than others,\" Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said on the call. \"And I think a big part of the reason that we are not seeing the same thing that others might is because we simply have merchants across a ton of verticals and across a ton of [geographies].\"\nFor the third quarter, Shopify said it expects revenue to grow at a low-to-mid-20s percentage rate year over year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect sales to grow 21% year over year to $2.07 billion.\nWATCH: Etsy CEO Josh Silverman: It's a tough time for the consumer\n\ntitle1:\nSoftBank earnings report Q1 FY 2024\ndescription1:\nWorkers on the stage as they prepare for a SoftBank Group Corp. news conference in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, June 27, 2024.\nSoftBank Group booked a 1.9 billion yen ($12.9 million) investment gain on its Vision Fund tech investment arm in the company's fiscal first quarter ended in June, swinging back into the black.\nGains in some of SoftBank's Chinese portfolio companies \u2014 including TikTok owner ByteDance \u2014 helped offset losses from other firms like AutoStore and Symbotic.\nHowever, the Vision Fund segment as a whole posted a 204.3 billion yen loss, after being in profit in the same quarter last year. The segment total takes into account other performance beyond investment, such as administrative expenses, as well as gains and losses attributable to third-party investors.\nThe Japanese giant also announced it would buy back up to 6.8% of shares available in the company amounting to up to 500 billion yen ($3.4 billion).\nIn the year ago quarter, SoftBank posted 159.77 billion yen gain in its Vision Fund. In the March quarter, SoftBank posted a loss of 57.53 billion yen in its flagship tech investment arm.\nSoftBank posted its first full-year gain since 2021 at the Vision Fund in the fiscal year ended March as it benefitted from a rally in technology stocks and within some of its key holdings.\nThe Vision Fund's recent success is also due in large part to the success of the initial public offering of chip designer Arm last year, of which SoftBank owns around 90% of the company.\nHowever, SoftBank is once more contending with volatile public markets. On Monday, SoftBank shares tanked nearly 19% in a day amid a broader fall in Japanese stocks stoked by an interest rate rise from the Bank of Japan last week.\nJapan's main indexes did rebound on Tuesday, however. But global markets remain volatile as investors remain concerned about the state of the world economy and high valuations in part driven by technology stocks.\nSoftBank, which itself has been marred by bad bets over the past few years, is trying to position itself to investors as a key player in the artificial intelligence boom. The company's management have highlighted its investments in companies like Arm and self-driving startup Wayve as indiciations that the Japanese giant is poised to capitalize on the growth of AI.\n\ntitle2:\nAnduril raises $1.5B at a $14B valuation\ndescription2:\nDefense tech startup Anduril has closed what will almost certainly end up being one of the largest funding rounds of the year: a $1.5 billion deal that values the company at $14 billion.\nAnduril has ambitions of becoming the next great American defense contractor, joining a class of companies that has shrunk to just five major firms: Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. These companies pull in billions in revenue from business with the U.S. Department of Defense, and their stranglehold on defense production is nearly absolute.\nBut the Palmer Luckey-founded defense startup is looking to become a serious rival to these longstanding kingpins, and it\u2019s recent wins have started to draw notice. Earlier this year, the company beat out Lockheed, Northrop and Boeing in a program to develop and test small unmanned fighter jet prototypes. Anduril is also betting that it can have an edge in contracts simply by moving faster than its competitors: bringing a Silicon Valley mentality to defense production, which moves notoriously slowly.\nThis latest round is a massive step up from Anduril\u2019s prior $8.5 billion valuation set in December 2022. The company reportedly told investors that it had doubled revenue to around $500 million last year, which would mean the current valuation is set at a 28 times multiple. This is high by many standards for late-stage startups, but especially so for traditional defense companies: Lockheed Martin\u2019s revenue multiple is about 1.9x, based on its current valuation and last year\u2019s revenues, while Boeing\u2019s is 1.3x. Albeit those lower multiples are on revenues that are billions of dollars higher: Lockheed Martin brought in $18.9 billion in 2023, it reported, and Boeing\u2019s revenues were nearly $78 billion for 2023, it reported.\nAnduril\u2019s new funding round was co-led by Founders Fund, which led Anduril\u2019s seed round in August 217 and its Series A, and Sands Capital, which has participated in multiple IPOs since Visa\u2019s public offering in 2008. Founders Fund\u2019s participation is hardly a surprise, though, given the firm\u2019s longstanding bet on Anduril. The company\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, Trae Stephens, is also a Founders Fund partner. The round also saw new participation from some major institutional investors, like Fidelity Management and Research Company, and Baillie Gifford.\nThe company said in a statement that the new funding will help scale a new software-defined manufacturing platform called \u201cArsenal,\u201d starting with the Arsenal-1 factory. That facility will increase Anduril\u2019s production space by over five million square feet in order to manufacture \u201ctens of thousands of autonomous military systems\u201d per year, with a workforce of more than 1,500 people.\nA separate manifesto outlines Anduril\u2019s rationale for scaling manufacturing specifically. The company\u2019s aim is to \u201chyper-scale\u201d defense production, and to produce defense systems at a scale that is not currently possible for exquisite military systems. But Anduril is not focused on making a few very expensive, exquisite systems; it\u2019s focused on producing many times more cheaper products, which can be hyper-scaled with a rebooted factory. Arsenal is meant to be exactly that: an adaptable, replicable model that \u201cscales indefinitely and makes it possible to rebuild the arsenal of democracy.\u201d\nNot only that: Anduril says the centrality of software will also make the factory even more efficient over time, with the Arsenal Operating System facilitating faster, cheaper manufacturing. This will no doubt have an effect on the products themselves, which Anduril says will be developed to be less dependent upon highly-specialized labor, it can help maximize the use of readily available components, and make iterative changes to products quickly.\nThe seven-year-old company\u2019s success with the government and private investors has helped spur a boom of interest in defense tech, a sector that had been previously thought of as nearly un-investable due to the long timelines in government contracting. However, it\u2019s unclear if Anduril\u2019s rising tide will truly lift all boats, or if Anduril will be (as is so often the case in Silicon Valley) the exception, not the rule.\n\ntitle3:\nYouTube is testing a feature that lets creators use Google Gemini to brainstorm video ideas\ndescription3:\nYouTube is testing an integration with Google Gemini to help creators brainstorm video ideas, titles and thumbnails. The Google-owned company announced the launch of the new Brainstorm with Gemini feature in a video posted to its Creator Insider channel.\nA YouTube spokesperson told TechCrunch that the feature is available to select creators as a part of a small, limited experiment. YouTube will consider feedback from creators before deciding whether to roll out the feature more broadly.\nThe new tool could give YouTube an edge over other social media video platforms frequently used by creators, as it offers them something that\u2019s not available on these competing platforms. In addition, it makes sense for Google to incorporate its AI into its video platform in order to encourage creators to use its AI tools instead of other popular platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nBrainstorm with Gemini is similar to another AI feature that YouTube launched in testing back in May, which is an AI-powered content inspiration tool that gives creators video topic ideas that their audience is interested in and then generates an outline of talking points to jump-start the creation process.\nThe spokesperson told TechCrunch that creators now have the option to get the same sort of help, but with Gemini, which is the brand name for the family of AI large language models used in a lot of Google products. YouTube sees the new addition as a way to gauge whether creators prefer the inspiration tool, the Gemini integration, or both when it comes to getting help with content ideas.\nCreators who are part of the experiment can open up YouTube Studio, type out a video idea into the search bar, then be presented with two options: the inspiration tool and the Brainstorm with Gemini feature. Although the inspiration tool already helps creators come up with video ideas, YouTube wants to test whether creators also find it helpful to brainstorm with Gemini as well.\nWhile platforms like TikTok and Instagram are currently focusing on using generative AI to give creators the ability to build digital versions of themselves, YouTube is zeroing in on using the technology to help creators build their content.\n\ntitle4:\nFacebook creators have a new way to avoid 'jail'\ndescription4:\nFacebook creators are being given a new option that will help them avoid jail \u2014 \u201cFacebook jail,\u201d that is \u2014 upon their first violation, and at various times after. In a revised policy, announced on Wednesday, social networking giant Meta said that creators who violate the company\u2019s Community Standards for the first time will be offered the option to take a new training course instead of receiving a formal warning.\nUpon completion of the course, the warning will be removed from the user\u2019s account, Meta explained in a blog post aimed at creators.\nImage Credits: Meta\nTypically, Facebook doles out penalties to users who break its rules, including throwing users into \u201cFacebook jail\u201d \u2014 a term that refers to their temporarily limited abilities to post and interact on the platform following a violation. Last year, Facebook introduced changes to this process, doling out more warnings before penalty actions were taken. Now, the company is making it possible to remove those initial warnings, too.\nFor creators, the change will help them maintain their reach and visibility on the platform, even if they make a mistake. It also follows a similar lightening of the penalty system run by YouTube, announced last year. Like YouTube now offers, Facebook creators will be able to take a short, educational course to wipe out their warning under the new guidelines.\nAs Meta explains, the updated policy is focused on \u201ceducating \u2014 not punishing\u201d first-time rulebreakers.\nThe option will first be made available to Professional Mode users (creators), who will receive an in-app notification that points them to the educational training focused on the policy they violated.\nIn addition to removing the warning from their account, the creator will be able to participate in this \u201cremove your warning\u201d training again if they make no further violations for one year.\nIf, however, they do violate policy again within a year, they\u2019ll receive a warning that can not be removed. Accumulating warnings and violations leads to the account facing penalties like reduced reach and more limited monetization opportunities.\nThe change, as well as the introduction of warnings, aims to make Facebook more approachable to newer creators who may be less familiar with its policies and rules. This, in turn, could better level the playing field for newcomers and make the platform more attractive to creators in general.\nHowever, the company stresses that the more serious community standards will not be eligible for warning removal under this new system. This includes content that contains \u201csexual exploitation, the sale of high-risk drugs, or glorification of dangerous organizations and individuals,\u201d notes Meta.\"\n\nResponse:",
