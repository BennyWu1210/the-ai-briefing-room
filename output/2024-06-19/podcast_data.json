Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday June 20), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title3:\nUpdate your Windows PC to avoid a serious Wi-Fi vulnerability\ndescription3:\nIf you\u2019ve been putting off your next Windows update, now\u2019s the time to install it. Last week, Microsoft patched a pretty nasty vulnerability in Windows 11 and 10 that could put your PC at risk when connected to a public Wi-Fi network, as spotted earlier by The Register.\nThe vulnerability (CVE-2024-30078) could let hackers deploy a malicious packet to devices connected to the same Wi-Fi networks in places like airports, coffee shops, hotels, or even workplaces. From there, hackers can remotely run commands and gain access to a system \u2014 all without any user interaction or authentication. Microsoft rolled out the patch as part of its monthly security update on June 11th.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta AI removes block on election-related queries in India while Google still applying limits\ndescription4:\nWith India\u2019s election process completed and the new government starting its tenure in office, Meta has removed its restriction on election-related queries using its Meta AI chatbot. However, Google is still applying limits as part of its global restrictions on this type of queries.\nMeta\u2019s approach\nMeta\u2019s restrictions lift means you can search for queries related to India\u2019s election results, information on politicians, and details about officeholders. TechCrunch was able to get answers about election results, political figures, and officeholders from Meta AI. Meta didn\u2019t provide any statement on this.\nThe company first started blocking certain political queries when the election in India commenced in April. At the time, Meta AI was pointing people toward the Election Commission\u2019s website when you asked it about politicians, candidates, officeholders, and information about political parties.\n\u201cThis is a new technology, and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems. Since we launched, we\u2019ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models, and we\u2019re continuing to work on making them better,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch at that time.\nNotably, Meta\u2019s AI chatbot is still in the test phase in India with limited number of people being able to access it on WhatsApp and Instagram.\nGoogle\u2019s approach\nGoogle launched its Gemini AI app for Android in India on Monday, which supports nine local languages. However, the company is not removing restrictions on election-related queries as part of a global policy. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it is still applying these limits.\n\u201cWith major elections happening around the world this year, and out of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses and instead point people to Google Search. These restrictions are applied globally,\u201d a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.\nThe search giant started applying restrictions to these queries in any global market where elections are taking place earlier this year. But it\u2019s not clear if and when Google will lift the restrictions \u2014 especially in countries where elections are completed and the new governments have assumed their roles.\nThe approach to a chatbot answering political queries is different for Meta and Google. While Meta restricted queries for a limited period, Google continues to block election-related queries globally. It\u2019s not clear if this decision has anything to do with Google\u2019s AI going astray multiple times this year.\nOther chatbots like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot have a mixed approach. TechCrunch found that both bots don\u2019t answer questions like \u201cWho won the Indian general election of 2024?\u201d However, these tools fetch information from the web when we ask them about officeholders and politicians.\nCompanies developing AI tools are already under scrutiny for outputs showing bias and misinformation. The last thing these companies would want to do is to be caught in the political crossfire while trying to expand their AI apps in more regions.\"\n\nResponse:",
