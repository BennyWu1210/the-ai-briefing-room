Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

The company began commercial passenger operations in August after a period of testing.\n\"We're committed to growing our service gradually and responsibly,\" Waymo said in the post. \"We work closely with city and state officials, first responders, and advocates for road safety to ensure our service helps local communities gain access to reliable, safe, environmentally friendly transportation and has a positive impact on mobility.\"\nIt is the second citywide rollout for Waymo, following Phoenix in 2020. Waymo One also operates in limited capacity in Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. As of February, the company had approximately 700 vehicles in the Waymo One fleet, including about 300 cars as part of its San Francisco service.\nDriverless vehicles have faced some public backlash in recent months following collisions and other accidents. In October, General Motors' Cruise autonomous vehicle unit paused all driverless operations after collisions led to investigations and a suspension of its licenses in California.\nHowever, Waymo has experienced less controversy. The company has a large public affairs operation and communicates closely with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and local first responders.\nIn total, the 15-year-old project, which became Waymo in 2016, has driven about 20 million fully autonomous miles and nearly two million paid ride-hail trips, Waymo said. The company said it has logged 3.8 million rider-only miles in San Francisco as of the end of March.\n\ntitle1:\nChatGPT for Mac is now available to all\ndescription1:\nYou can now more easily use ChatGPT on your Mac computer. OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot is available to all macOS users, the company announced on Tuesday. The app was first announced ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in June, where the companies jointly announced integrations between OpenAI\u2019s chatbot and Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nOn the latter platform, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space after installing the new ChatGPT app.\nThe ChatGPT desktop app for macOS is now available for all users.\nGet faster access to ChatGPT to chat about email, screenshots, and anything on your screen with the Option + Space shortcut: https://t.co/2rEx3PmMqg pic.twitter.com/x9sT8AnjDm \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 25, 2024\nThis makes access to the AI chatbot something that will immediately feel familiar to macOS users who regularly use other keyboard shortcuts like Command + Space to pop up a search bar to access Spotlight Search. But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools. These integrations are also powered by GPT-4o and will roll out to Apple customers later this year with the launch of Apple\u2019s newest operating systems.\n\ntitle2:\nVW will invest up to $5 billion in Rivian as part of new EV joint venture\ndescription2:\nVolkswagen is investing $1 billion in Rivian as part of a new joint venture that will give the German auto giant access to the buzzy California EV company\u2019s software and EV platform. Rivian will receive an additional $4 billion over time, for a total sum of $5 billion.\nThe joint venture will be co-owned by Rivian and VW Group, which oversees brands like Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, and its flagship Volkswagen. The two companies will introduce vehicles developed from the joint venture in the \u201csecond half of the decade,\u201d they announced.\nThe new venture was announced in a post from Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, who noted the investment will help the company bring its next generation R2 electric vehicle to market starting in 2026. The R2 is expected to be a more affordable $45,000 model than its current luxury-priced EVs, the R1T and R1S.\nThe companies said the partnership will bring Rivian\u2019s new zonal architecture, available now through its refreshed second-generation R1 vehicles, as well as its vehicle software, to a \u201cbroader market.\u201d Rivian recently became one of the few companies beyond Tesla to use a zonal architecture for its vehicles that rely on fewer electric control units than usual.\nVW Group CEO Oliver Blume said all of the company\u2019s brands could benefit from the partnership with Rivian, including potential competitor Scout Motors, which is planning to launch a new lineup of electric trucks in the US.\nAs the two companies began to discuss a partnership, Scaringe said there was a lot of \u201cshared appreciation\u201d around products and technology. The Rivian CEO also said he grew up as a \u201cmassive Porsche enthusiast\u201d who would restore old 356s.\n\u201cWhat we found is a partnership and a relationship that was very consistent with our own beliefs,\u201d he said in a briefing with reporters. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that I say lightly.\u201d\nThe first $1 billion will be provided to Rivian in the form of an unsecure convertible note that will become Rivian common stock \u201csubject to regulatory approval,\u201d the companies said. An additional investment of up to $2 billion is expected to take place through two tranches of $1 billion each in 2025 and 2026.\n\u201cWe are running very well and very quick, quicker than we expected,\u201d Blume said in the briefing.\n\u201cWe are running very well and very quick, quicker than we expected.\u201d\nThe money will no doubt come in handy, too. Like other EV-only companies, Rivian has been struggling through a period of cooling demand around electric vehicles. The company\u2019s sales are up, but its losses are also increasing. It has $7.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand, but it has acknowledged that cuts could be necessary if it\u2019s ever going to achieve stability. Rivian has already gone through several rounds of layoffs in its short history.\nMeanwhile, VW has been going through its own struggles around EVs. The company\u2019s plug-in models are selling well, but its market share in North America is shrinking. And its software has been plagued by bugs and customer complaints.\nVW isn\u2019t the first legacy automaker to partner with Rivian. The company was planning to co-develop an electric SUV with Ford, but those plans were cancelled amid the covid pandemic. The plan was to use Rivian\u2019s battery pack and electric motor setup in a Ford or Lincoln branded SUV. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian as part of the plan, along with $700 million from Amazon.\nAsked whether the deal would make Rivian the exclusive partner to VW and its brands, Scaringe declined to answer directly.\n\ntitle3:\nMicrosoft's 'abusive' bundling of Teams, Office products breached antitrust rules, EU says\ndescription3:\nThe European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the \"abusive\" bundling of its Teams and Office products.\n\"The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,\" the European Commission \u2014 the EU's executive arm \u2014 said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them.\nIf the commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue.\nMicrosoft took the preemptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were \"insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition.\"\nMicrosoft said it would work to find solutions to address the commission's additional concerns. \"Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,\" Microsoft's vice chair and president, Brad Smith, said in a statement Tuesday. The company's shares were broadly unchanged in premarket trading Tuesday.\nThe EU opened its investigation into Microsoft \u2014 which remains ongoing \u2014 in July 2023 after a complaint by Salesforce -owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams.\nThe commission's concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software as a service \u2014 or SaaS \u2014 applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is \"dominant worldwide\" in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications.\n\"In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,\" EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant's advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability \u2014 the ability of two or more systems to work together \u2014 between Microsoft's offerings and Teams' competitors.\n\"The conduct may have prevented Teams' rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,\" the commission said.\n\ntitle4:\nEtched raises $120 million to build chip to take on Nvidia in AI\ndescription4:\nNvidia has been the hottest story on Wall Street of late, increasing eightfold in value since the end of 2022 and soaring past $3 trillion in market cap this month.\nA 2-year-old startup founded by Harvard dropouts has just raised $120 million in venture funding to try and build a competitive chip and take on Nvidia in artificial intelligence.\nHeadquartered in Cupertino, California \u2014 home to Apple \u2014 Etched is developing a chip called Sohu, which the company says will be used to train and deploy AI models using \"transformers,\" the core architecture underpinning advancements like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nCo-founder and CEO Gavin Uberti said that as AI develops, most of the technology's power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. Their efficiency comes in executing only the AI model they were designed to perform, in contrast to general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia that are more capable but are also much costlier.\n\"We're making the biggest bet in AI,\" Uberti said in an interview. \"If transformers go away, we'll die. But if they stick around, we're the biggest company of all time.\"\nUberti and his co-founders are aware that it's a high-risk wager, and that they're going up against some of the most richly capitalized and competitive companies on the planet. While $120 million is a lot of money to raise in a series A, it's about how much Nvidia generates in revenue in half a day. Nvidia's sales have more than tripled annually for three consecutive quarters, topping $26 billion in the latest period.\nNvidia has more than 80% of the market share for AI chips, according to estimates. Etched is among a group of startups attracting capital to go after the burgeoning opportunity. Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures led the round. Peter Thiel, Stanley Druckenmiller and Cruise founder Kyle Vogt are also backers.\nDespite Nvidia's head start and, what some developers describe a moat, new chipmakers are plowing ahead anyway, mainly because the opportunity is so big. Other chip startups taking on Nvidia include Cerebras Systems, which is building a physically larger AI chip, and Tenstorrent, which is using a trendy technology called RISC-V to build AI chips.\n\"The reason we were so excited about what we're doing, why we dropped out of school and we've convinced so many people to leave these chip projects \u2014 this is the most important thing to be working on,\" said Robert Wachen, Etched's operating chief. \"The entire future of technology is going to be shaped by whether the infrastructure can handle the scale.\"\nSemiconductors have traditionally been one of the hardest industries for startups given the long development cycles, the significant capital required to build a chip and the need to engage with a limited number of manufacturing partners, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , which is building Etched's chip.\nVenture capitalists invested $6 billion in AI semiconductor companies in 2023, up slightly from $5.7 billion in 2022, according to data from PitchBook.\"\n\nResponse:",
