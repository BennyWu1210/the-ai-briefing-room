Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Mike Lynch, the U.K. investor and founder of IT company Autonomy, has been identified as one of two bodies recovered from the Bayesian, the yacht that sunk off the coast of Sicily early Monday, according to several reports coming out of the country that cite the chief of Civil Protection, Salvo Cocina.\nLynch\u2019s daughter, Hannah, has also been identified.\nThe news caps off a grim few days of events. The boat, registered to Lynch\u2019s wife, Angela Bacares, quickly capsized in the early hours of Monday after it was struck by a tornado-like water column. Bacares was among the 15 survivors, but three bodies have now been found and four more are still being recovered from the wreck. Those yet to be found include the international chairman of Morgan Stanley bank, his wife, a lawyer from New York who worked with Lynch, and his wife.\nAs we previously reported, the Bayesian was on a voyage to celebrate Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a criminal fraud trial in the U.S. earlier this summer. That trial also involved a co-defendant, Stephen Chamberlain.\nIn a tragic coincidence, Chamberlain was hit by a car last Saturday and died of his wounds earlier this week.\nLynch was one of the most well-known and colorful figures in the U.K. technology world \u2014 sometimes referred to as the \u201cBill Gates of U.K. tech.\u201d\nHP acquired Lynch\u2019s enterprise technology firm Autonomy in 2011 for $11 billion \u2014 a major milestone for U.K. technology and one of the biggest tech M&A deals at the time. But it quickly turned sour, and HP sued Lynch and Autonomy\u2019s director of finance, Chamberlain, arguing it was misled in the transaction.\nHP claimed that the deal led to a $4 billion+ loss \u2014 money it then demanded from Lynch and Chamberlain. Lynch (pictured above, left) and his co-defendant long asserted that they acted in good faith and were being made into scapegoats over a merger gone bad.\nThat legal drama went on for more than a decade and involved a host of other thorny chapters, including Lynch\u2019s extradition to the U.S. over the DoJ criminal suit (the one that only recently concluded with acquittal) and a lot of very bad publicity for him. It also included a second, civil case that took place in 2022 in the U.K., which Lynch lost.\nThe U.S. criminal case, where Lynch and Chamberlain were charged with 15 counts of fraud and conspiracy and could have spelled jail for the pair, went to trial earlier this year in San Francisco. Then finally, in June, Lynch and Chamberlain were acquitted.\nIn the interim years, Lynch built up a profile in the U.K. as a prominent investor, most prominently as the founder of Invoke Capital.\nThe VC firm was the biggest investor in cybersecurity firm Darktrace, a connection that was not without its own controversy. It also invested in Sophia Genetics, Featurespace and Luminance, among others. And it appeared that this is the route that he had been planning to continue to pursue.\n\u201cI am elated with today\u2019s verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last 10 weeks. My deepest thanks go to my legal team for their tireless work on my behalf,\u201d Lynch said at the time of the acquittal in June. \u201cI am looking forward to returning to the U.K. and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field.\u201d\nOur thoughts go out to Lynch\u2019s (and Chamberlain\u2019s) family, friends and colleagues. We have also reached out to Lynch\u2019s spokespeople and will update this post as we learn more.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest security update has ruined dual-boot Windows and Linux PCs\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest monthly security update is wreaking havoc on dual-boot Windows and Linux systems. The software giant issued a security patch last week to fix a two-year-old vulnerability in the GRUB open-source boot loader used by lots of Linux devices. Microsoft\u2019s patch wasn\u2019t supposed to hit dual-boot devices, but many have found it has and it\u2019s now stopping their Linux installs from booting properly.\nArs Technica reports that multiple Linux dual-boot users are seeing \u201csecurity policy violation\u201d messages, along with \u201csomething has gone seriously wrong\u201d errors. There are reports of issues across Reddit, Ubuntu forums, and elsewhere. Distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Puppy Linux have all been affected by Microsoft\u2019s patch.\nThe update was supposed to fix a vulnerability that allowed hackers to bypass Secure Boot, a technology that\u2019s widely used by Windows and Linux distributions to ensure malicious firmware isn\u2019t loaded onto devices during boot. Microsoft said earlier this month it would apply \u201ca Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) update to block vulnerable Linux boot loaders that could have an impact on Windows security,\u201d but that the update would not be applied to dual-boot systems with both Windows and Linux so it \u201cshould not affect these systems.\u201d\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t commented on the issues its update has caused, but there is a workaround for Ubuntu users that involves disabling Secure Boot at the BIOS level and then logging into a Ubuntu user account and opening a terminal to delete Microsoft\u2019s SBAT policy.\nMicrosoft has been using Secure Boot in Windows for years, and made it a key requirement for Windows 11 to use the technology to secure against BIOS rootkits. Researchers have found plenty of vulnerabilities in Secure Boot over the years, and recently it was discovered that Secure Boot is completely broken on many PCs.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI exec says California\u2019s AI safety bill might slow progress\ndescription2:\nIn a new letter, OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon insists that AI regulations should be left to the federal government. As reported previously by Bloomberg, Kwon says that a new AI safety bill under consideration in California could slow progress and cause companies to leave the state.\nA federally-driven set of AI policies, rather than a patchwork of state laws, will foster innovation and position the U.S. to lead the development of global standards. As a result, we join other AI labs, developers, experts and members of California\u2019s Congressional delegation in respectfully opposing SB 1047 and welcome the opportunity to outline some of our key concerns.\nThe letter is addressed to California State Senator Scott Wiener, who originally introduced SB 1047, also known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act.\nAccording to proponents like Wiener, it establishes standards ahead of the development of more powerful AI models, requires precautions like pre-deployment safety testing and other safeguards, adds whistleblower protections for employees of AI labs, gives California\u2019s Attorney General power to take legal action if AI models cause harm, and calls for establishing a \u201cpublic cloud computer cluster\u201d called CalCompute.\nIn a response to the letter published Wednesday evening, Wiener points out that the proposed requirements apply to any company doing business in California, whether they are headquartered in the state or not, so the argument \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d He also writes that OpenAI \u201c...doesn\u2019t criticize a single provision of the bill\u201d and closes by saying, \u201cSB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill that asks large AI labs to do what they\u2019ve already committed to doing, namely, test their large models for catastrophic safety risk.\u201d\nThe bill is currently awaiting its final vote before going to Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk.\n\ntitle3:\nBlockchain startup Story raises funds from a16z to stop IP theft by AI\ndescription3:\nGenerative AI models require huge amounts of training data to enable their systems to produce advanced outputs. But the data that goes into them is often from sources where copyright restrictions are in place. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty Images\nSan-Francisco-based startup Story said Wednesday that it raised $80 million of funding for a blockchain designed to prevent artificial intelligence makers like OpenAI from taking creators' intellectual property without permission. The round values the two-year-old company at $2.25 billion, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. The sources preferred not to be named as the information has not been made public. Story said that it raised the funds in a Series B round \u2014 typically the third major round of funding in a private startup's growth journey after seed and Series A \u2014 led by Andreessen Horowitz, which is also known as a16z. Crypto-focused venture capital firm Polychain also invested in the round. Story, which is unprofitable and doesn't disclose revenue, is riding high on hopes from backers that its solution will give creators the ability to be attributed and compensated for work that gets fed into popular artificial intelligence platforms such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity's AI-powered search engine.\nBuilding an 'IP legoland'\nA blockchain is a distributed database that maintains an immutable record of activity. It is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether. Story acts as a blockchain network that allows creators to prove they made a piece of content and are the intellectual property owners by storing their IP on the platform. The firm's tech works to protect individuals and entities' IP by embedding terms associated with it, such as licensing fees and royalty-sharing arrangements, into smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital contracts stored on a blockchain that automatically execute once a certain set of terms are met.\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday. Subscribe\nThis makes copyright holders' IP \"programmable,\" SY Lee, Story's co-founder and CEO, explained to CNBC, as it sets up rules for how their content can be used and the price to pay for reproducing or remixing their works. The benefit of this, Lee said, is that it effectively cuts out the middlemen typically involved in disputes over copyright theft in the media landscape. \"Now it's turned from IP into IP Lego,\" Lee told CNBC. \"Now, you don't need to go through lawyers. You don't need to go through the agents. You don't need to do this very lengthy business development negotiation. You just embed your licensing, royalty-sharing terms into small contracts.\" Story makes money by charging a network fee for any action that takes place on its network. One example of a firm using Story is Ablo, an AI tool that allows users to make their own tailored items of fashion using designs from household brands including French designer clothing firm Balmain and Italian luxury fashion house Dolce and Gabbana. Brands are compensated for their use of fashion designers' IP through various respective licensing and revenue-sharing agreements.\nFighting AI copyright theft\nStory is now trying to tackle a timely problem with its tech \u2014 theft of copyrighted media on the internet by powerful generative AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. These models, which power many AI chatbots that are increasingly being used as an alternative to search, require huge amounts of training data to enable their systems to produce advanced and informative answers to user queries. But the data that goes into fueling these AI models is often from sources where there's copyright restrictions in place. The New York Times last year hit Microsoft and OpenAI with a copyright lawsuit seeking damages over abuse of the newspaper's intellectual property. In the suit, the Times included several examples of instances where GPT-4 produced altered versions of material originally published by the newspaper. Big tech companies like Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI and is reportedly entitled to a 49% stake in the firm, are \"essentially stealing your IP for training purposes and actually capturing all the upside,\" Lee said. In a motion to dismiss part of the Times' suit in March, Microsoft said that such claims were \"unsubstantiated,\" and that the lawsuit presented a false narrative of \"doomsday futurology.\" Content used to train these models, Microsoft's lawyers argued, \"does not supplant the market for the works, it teaches the models language.\" Microsoft was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC about Lee's comments.\nwatch now\n\ntitle4:\nTesla\u2019s latest Model X recall isn\u2019t just a software update\ndescription4:\nTesla is issuing a new recall for more than 9,000 of its Model X SUVs due to roof cosmetic trim pieces that could fly off while driving because they may have been adhered without primer. It\u2019s the second such recall from the company to address the issue on the Model X, the first one issued in 2020, and it is again specific to early 2016 vehicle models.\nTesla often pushes software updates to address recalls, including a repeat Autopilot safety issue where it does not warn drivers effectively. But for the Model X roof issue, Tesla will need to actually take a gander at thousands of vehicles in person.\nTo remedy the Model X voluntary recall, Tesla Service will \u201ctest the roof trim adhesion and reattach the trim pieces as necessary\u201d for free.\nTesla had found that the 2020 recall remedy did not thoroughly detect trim pieces that could detach, according to Reuters. The automaker says no crashes or injuries have been reported, but it has received about 170 issue reports and claims from owners that this recall may cover.\"\n\nResponse:",

    "Image Prompt": "a cohesive podcast cover image featuring a serene mediterranean seascape at dusk with a luxurious yacht partially submerged, representing the sicily yacht tragedy. the yacht, although beautiful, is left in a state of partial sinking with water breaching its deck. nestled seamlessly into the background, a modern laptop sits on a cliffside overlooking the scene, signifying microsoft's dual-boot troubles; its screen flickers between two operating system logos, hinting at the technical dilemma. looming above, a futuristic drone hovers in the twilight sky, casting a soft spotlight on the yacht below, embodying openai's forward-thinking regulatory ambitions. the elements blend smoothly into a singular, dramatic, yet contemplative image, encapsulating the essence of the episode's topics"
