Since January, it has introduced iOS and Android apps, a Team plan for businesses and an international expansion into Europe.\nGitLab, Midjourney and Menlo Ventures have all been beta testers and early clients of Claude Enterprise, along with North Highland Consulting and Sourcegraph, according to Anthropic. GitLab used the product for content creation and responding to requests for proposals in a more automated way, Scott White, a product manager at Anthropic, told CNBC in an interview.\n\"[We're] moving to a world where these models will behave much more like virtual collaborators than virtual assistants,\" White said.\nClaude Enterprise allows clients to upload relevant documents with a much larger context window than before \u2014 the equivalent of 100 30-minute sales conversations, 100,000 lines of code or 15 full financial reports, according to Anthropic. The plan also allows \"activity feeds\" for super-users within a company to show those newer to AI how they're making use of the technology, White said.\nPricing will depend on each organization's needs, an Anthropic representative told CNBC, but factors will include scale of usage, such as number of users and query volume, and specific feature requirements such as depth of integration.\nIn a presentation viewed by CNBC, Anthropic said Claude Enterprise provides company privacy, role-based access and project-based invitations, and that audit logs are coming soon. \"Anthropic does not train our models on your Claude for Work data,\" a slide said.\nAbout a dozen people work solely on Claude Enterprise, and the company has been working on the product since at least January, White said. Companies in a wide range of industries have expressed interest in the product, he said, including in the legal and consulting spaces, as well as financial services and software.\nThe Claude Enterprise launch follows Anthropic's June debut of its more powerful Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and its May rollout of its \"Team\" plan for smaller businesses.\nThe Team plan had been in development over the last few quarters and involved beta testing with between 30 and 50 customers in industries such as technology, financial services, legal services and health care, Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC in an interview at the time. The idea for the service was partially born out of many of those same customers asking for a dedicated enterprise product, Amodei added.\nIn June, Anthropic also announced \"Artifacts,\" which it said allows a user to ask its Claude chatbot to, for example, generate a text document or code and then opens the result in a dedicated window.\nArtifacts, or \"workspaces\" that allow users to \"see, edit and build upon Claude's creations in real time,\" are a key draw for clients to Claude Enterprise, White told CNBC. He added that the feature will allow Enterprise clients to create marketing calendars, feed in sales data, make dashboards or forecasts, draft code for features, write legal documents, summarize complex contracts, automate legal tasks and more.\nShortly after Anthropic's debut of Teams in May, Mike Krieger, co-founder and former chief technology officer of Meta-owned Instagram, joined the company as chief product officer. Under Krieger, the platform grew to 1 billion users and its engineering team grew to more than 450 people, according to a press release. OpenAI's former safety leader Jan Leike joined the company that same month.\nAs startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI gain steam in the generative AI business, they \u2014 alongside tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta \u2014 have been part of an AI arms race to integrate the technology to ensure they don't fall behind in a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\ntitle1:\nQualcomm launches latest AI PC chip in challenge to Intel and AMD\ndescription1:\nIn this article QCOM Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nA view of the logo of Qualcomm at the Mobile World Congress 2024. Ramon Costa | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nQualcomm launched a new PC processor on Wednesday as it looks to capitalize on electronics makers' desire to put artificial intelligence on their devices. The move ramps up Qualcomm's efforts to challenge the dominance of Intel in the PC processor market at a time when the latter is facing mounting challenges. Qualcomm took the wraps off the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core at the IFA conference in Berlin, Germany. The processor, designed for PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system, promises to power AI processes with a long battery life. The latest chips expand Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Series for PCs, which it launched last year. The U.S. chip giant said the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core is designed for PCs costing as low as $700 as it looks to expand its semiconductors to more devices. Qualcomm has traditionally designed chips that are used in the smartphones of many of the world's biggest players, including Samsung. But the company stepped up its PC efforts this year when Microsoft announced a Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with Qualcomm's X Series chips that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Microsoft calls these Copilot+ PCs.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said that the company's push into PC chips forms part of a broader \"diversification\" story for the company away from just mobile chipsets. The company has also been building out its growing automotive business, with AI a key part of its strategy. \"We are on a journey to diversify and make sure our technology is now expanding into other markets,\" Amon said in a TV interview Wednesday. He added that the PC market is \"fundamentally\" changing due to two things: mobile-PC convergence \u2014 in other words, people are coming to expect the same performance they get from their phones around things like battery life \u2014 and the convergence of AI with desktop computers. Analysts said Qualcomm's timing to jump into PCs is key. Neil Shah, a partner at Counterpoint Research, highlighted a few converging themes that are helping the company. He highlighted the push toward \"on-device AI,\" where artificial intelligence applications are processed on a piece of hardware rather than via the internet. Qualcomm has designed processors for smartphones that do this. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Series is built on architecture from British chip designer Arm , allowing the processors to run complex applications with good energy-efficiency. This is key to extending battery life on devices. \"Since the AI boom happened last year, everything has been centered around AI which works well for Qualcomm because they have been ahead in the low powered AI device experiences on mobile,\" Shah told CNBC. \"Translating that to the PC form factor was not that difficult.\" The support of Microsoft has also been important for Qualcomm to hit the mainstream in PCs, since Windows is one of the world's biggest operating systems, Shah said. \"The stars have aligned for Qualcomm,\" Shah said.\nPC chip roadmap\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever raises $1 billion for his new AI firm\ndescription2:\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who left the artificial intelligence startup in May, has raised $1 billion from investors for his new AI company, Safe Superintelligence, or SSI.\nThe company announced in a post on X that investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global and SV Angel, as well as NFDG, an investment partnership co-run by SSI executive Daniel Gross.\n\"We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product,\" Sutskever wrote on X in May to announce the new venture.\nSutskever was OpenAI's chief scientist and co-led the company's Superalignment team with Jan Leike, who left in May to join rival AI firm Anthropic. Shortly after their departures, OpenAI disbanded the team, just one year after it announced the group. Some of the team members were reassigned to other teams within the company, a source familiar with the situation told CNBC at the time.\nLeike wrote in a post on X at the time that OpenAI's \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\nSutskever started SSI with Daniel Gross, who oversaw Apple's AI and search efforts, and former OpenAI employee Daniel Levy. The company has offices in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\"SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus,\" the company posted on X. \"Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\"\nSutskever was one of the OpenAI board members involved in the temporary ouster of co-founder and CEO Sam Altman in November.\nIn November, OpenAI's board said in a statement that Altman had not been \"consistently candid in his communications with the board.\" The issue quickly came to look more complex. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that artificial intelligence would not harm humans, while others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.\nAlmost all of OpenAI's employees signed an open letter saying they would leave in response to the board's action. Days later, Altman was back at the company.\nFollowing Altman's sudden ouster and before his quick reinstatement, Sutskever publicly apologized for his role in the ordeal.\n\"I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions,\" Sutskever wrote in a post on X on Nov. 20. \"I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.\"\n\ntitle3:\nPaylocity is acquiring corporate spend startup Airbase for $325M\ndescription3:\nHR and payroll software company Paylocity has agreed to acquire corporate spend startup Airbase for $325 million, the companies announced Wednesday.\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of Paylocity\u2019s fiscal year, which would be sometime in the next 30 to 60 days. It is being funded by borrowings under Paylocity\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nIt\u2019s a decent exit for seven-year-old Airbase, which was founded by Thejo Kote in 2017 to provide software to midsized companies seeking to better manage their spending. Its platform included bill payments, corporate cards, and employee reimbursements, among other things.\nThe San Francisco-based fintech company had raised just over $100 million in equity funding since inception from investors such as Menlo Ventures, Bain Capital and First Round Capital, among others. According to PitchBook, Airbase was valued at $600 million post-money in 2021 at the peak of the market.\nHeadquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois, Paylocity is publicly traded and, according to Yahoo Finance, has a current market capitalization of just under $9 billion, with about 40,000 customers. The company in a statement said the addition of Airbase would help it expand its total addressable market beyond human capital management (HCM) and \u201cfurther into the office of the CFO.\u201d\nKote told TechCrunch the decision wasn\u2019t easy but made sense in the end.\n\u201cAirbase has many years of runway and a clear path to profitability, but I was ultimately convinced by the fantastic opportunity to create a unified HCM and Finance platform for the mid-market \u2014 leveraging Paylocity\u2019s size and scale to bring Airbase to a much larger audience.\u201d\nA source familiar with the deal who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch that the structured deal does not include all of the cash on Airbase\u2019s balance sheet, which goes back to the company, shareholders and employees. Including that, the entire value of the deal is actually \u201ca little less than $400 million,\u201d the source said.\nAirbase has just over 300 employees. It is not yet known how many will be joining Paylocity. The company over the years has competed with the likes of Ramp and Brex, with a focus on selling software from its early days. At one point, it said it surpassed \u201ceight figures\u201d in annual recurring revenue (ARR), although the company has not shared exact numbers.\nThis isn\u2019t the first exit for Kote, who in 2017 sold Automatic to SiriusXM for over $100 million.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist.\nThese are small numbers compared to the number of staff Musk laid off following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. In April 2023, Musk told the BBC that Twitter, as it was known then, reduced its headcount by 6,000 workers in six months, leaving the company\u2019s workforce at around 1,500 employees when layoffs were completed.\nThose cuts had included significant reductions for the company\u2019s trust and safety team. In January this year, following an inquiry from Australia\u2019s online safety commissioner, X said that it had laid off 80% of its trust and safety staff since Musk\u2019s takeover. X also said in its responses that before Musk\u2019s acquisition, the company had 279 engineers on its trust and safety teams around the world, which were cut down to 55 by the end of May 2023.\nOverall, X said it reduced its 4,062-strong trust and safety team by almost a third to 2,849 employees; its full-time content moderation team from 107 to 51 employees; and its contracted moderators from 2,613 to 2,305 employees, according to the Australian eSafety Commissioner\u2019s report at the time.\nA screenshot of the Australian eSafety Commissioner\u2019s report on X, which included statistics on X\u2019s job cuts from its trust and safety and content moderation teams. Image Credits: TechCrunch / screenshot\nThe recent job listings appear to confirm that X is trying to further beef up its safety team following the company\u2019s announcement in January that it would create a new Trust and Safety center in Austin, Texas, which will include 100 full-time content moderators.\nNine of the two-dozen jobs posted in the last month mention Austin among the possible locations, though the postings also include other cities, like New York City and Palo Alto, California, plus international offices like Manila in the Philippines and Delhi in India.\nWhen TechCrunch asked X\u2019s press team a series of questions about these new hires, including the size of the company\u2019s safety and cybersecurity teams, the company responded with an automated message: \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d\nDeparture\u2019s in X\u2019s trust and safety and cybersecurity teams have not been limited to its staff, but also included senior leadership. Since Musk took over, both the company\u2019s chief cybersecurity officer Lea Kissner and the company\u2019s trust and safety lead Ella Irwin have left.\nThe reduction in staff on the trust and safety and cybersecurity teams appear to have hurt X\u2019s ability to secure itself and its users, as well as deal with complex content moderation issues all over the world.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court in Brazil essentially banned X across the country after Musk refused to remove accounts spreading misinformation. Since taking over as Twitter\u2019s owner, Musk himself has been accused of spreading hateful content and misinformation. On Tuesday, Musk promoted a podcast episode featuring a guest accused of engaging in Holocaust denialism.
