Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Microsoft , Nvidia and Apple are reportedly in talks to join as well.\nTiger Global, based in New York, has been a big investor in tech startups and later-stage companies for at least 15 years, dating back to pre-IPO investments in Facebook and LinkedIn. In recent years, the firm has invested in other fast-growing AI companies including Scale AI and Cohere. It first bought shares in OpenAI in 2021.\nThe Information was the first to report on Tiger's planned participation.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI was valued at a reported $80 billion, up from $29 billion the prior year. Annualized revenue reportedly surpassed $2 billion earlier this year.\nGrowth took off in late 2022 after the company launched its ChatGPT chatbot. That momentum has continued with new OpenAI products for businesses and an expansion into AI-generated photos and videos. The company has doubled its number of weekly active users from late last year to 200 million, according to OpenAI.\nThe news comes one day after OpenAI released o1, a preview of its new AI model focused on reasoning and \"solving hard problems.\" It also comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined leaders from Anthropic, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon , and several American power and utility companies at the White House to discuss the future of artificial intelligence energy infrastructure in the U.S.\nThe group also talked about bringing the public and private sectors together to talk about AI's energy usage, data center capacity, semiconductor manufacturing and grid capacity, sources familiar with the meeting told CNBC.\nA spokesperson for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u2014 CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed reporting.\n\ntitle1:\nFei-Fei Li's World Labs comes out of stealth with $230M in funding\ndescription1:\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford professor many deem the \u201cGodmother of AI,\u201d has raised $230 million for her new startup, World Labs, from backers including Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Radical Ventures.\nWorld Labs is valued at over $1 billion, and the capital was raised over two rounds spaced a couple of months apart, TechCrunch reported in August.\nLi\u2019s company, which hopes to have its first product ready in 2025, aims to build AI models that understand and interact with the 3D world. World Labs is developing what it calls \u201clarge world models\u201d that will be used by professionals such as artists, designers, developers, and engineers. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told Wired that World Labs\u2019 customers could include game companies or movie studios.\n\ntitle2:\nLarry Ellison briefly passes Jeff Bezos as world's second richest man\ndescription2:\nOracle 's best week on the stock market since 2021 has bolstered Chairman Larry Ellison's net worth, briefly edging him past Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Friday to become the world's second-richest person.\nEllison's net worth reached $208.4 billion shortly after the market open, then fell to $197 billion, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list. Bezos, who has claimed the title of world's second-richest person on and off over the years, is worth $204 billion. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk, at $252 billion, is currently above him.\nOracle shares closed up slightly at $162.03 on Friday after the database vendor bumped up its fiscal 2026 revenue guidance and issued a rosy forecast as far out as fiscal 2029. The company issued the forward-looking revenue figures at its annual CloudWorld conference in Las Vegas.\nThe stock rallied 11% on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly results that topped expectations. Oracle shares continue to reach new highs and are now up about 54% this year, behind only artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia \u2014 up 141% \u2014 among large-cap tech stocks.\nEllison, who co-founded Oracle in 1977, has been the biggest beneficiary of the boom. He owns about 40% of the outstanding stock, making him the company's biggest stakeholder. His company's revival in recent years has been sparked by its improving position in cloud infrastructure and growing adoption of its cloud databases.\nBezos, 60, and Ellison, 80, are jockeying for the title of world's second-richest person three days after their companies forged a new partnership. On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers.\nOver the past year, Oracle has also forged similar partnerships with Microsoft and Google , the other two leading cloud infrastructure companies. Ellison told analysts on this week's earnings call that Oracle is now in prime position in the cloud and in traditional data centers.\n\"With Oracle Database to be able to run AWS, Microsoft and Google, is incredibly important,\" Ellison said on the call. \"It will absolutely accelerate database growth in the public cloud. But we expect that private clouds will greatly outnumber public clouds as companies decide they don't want \u2014 they want the Oracle Cloud behind their firewall, in their datacenter, with no neighbors.\"\n\u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet and Ari Levy contributed reporting.\n\ntitle3:\nUber and Waymo partnership expanding to Austin and Atlanta\ndescription3:\nIn this article GOOGL\nUBER Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nA Waymo autonomous self-driving Jaguar electric vehicle sits parked at an EVgo charging station in Los Angeles, California, on May 15, 2024. Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty Images\nUber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%. Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber's app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla 's planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber's market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymo's 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced.\nwatch now\n\"We're thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. Uber's initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won't include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but they're exploring that possibility for the future. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, \"We've been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can't wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.\" The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber's advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GM 's Cruise and the SoftBank -backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise's previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead.\nwatch now\nWaymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August. Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment. \u2014 CNBC's Laura Batchelor and Lora Kolodny contributed to this article.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta reignites plans to train AI using UK users' public Facebook and Instagram posts\ndescription4:\nMeta has confirmed that it\u2019s restarting efforts to train its AI systems using public Facebook and Instagram posts from its U.K. userbase.\nThe company claims it has \u201cincorporated regulatory feedback\u201d into a revised \u201copt-out\u201d approach to ensure that it\u2019s \u201ceven more transparent,\u201d as its blog post spins it. It is also seeking to paint the move as enabling its generative AI models to \u201creflect British culture, history, and idiom.\u201d But it\u2019s less clear what exactly is different about its latest data grab.\nFrom next week, Meta said U.K. users will start to see in-app notifications explaining what it\u2019s doing. The company then plans to start using public content to train its AI in the coming months \u2014 or at least do training on data where a user has not actively objected via the process Meta provides.\nThe announcement comes three months after Facebook\u2019s parent company paused its plans due to regulatory pressure in the U.K., with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) raising concerns over how Meta might use U.K. user data to train its generative AI algorithms \u2014 and how it was going about gaining people\u2019s consent. The Irish Data Protection Commission, Meta\u2019s lead privacy regulator in the European Union (EU), also objected to Meta\u2019s plans after receiving feedback from several data protection authorities across the bloc \u2014 there is no word yet on when, or if, Meta will restart its AI training efforts in the EU.\nFor context, Meta has been boosting its AI off user-generated content in markets such as the U.S. for some time but Europe\u2019s comprehensive privacy regulations have created challenges for it \u2014 and for other tech companies \u2014 looking to expand their training datasets in this way.\nDespite the existence of EU privacy laws, back in May Meta began notifying users in the region of an upcoming privacy policy change, saying that it would begin using content from comments, interactions with companies, status updates, and photos and their associated captions for AI training. The reasons for doing so, it argued, was that it needed to reflect \u201cthe diverse languages, geography and cultural references of the people in Europe.\u201d\nThe changes were due to come into effect on June 26 but Meta\u2019s announcement spurred privacy rights nonprofit noyb (aka \u201cnone of your business\u201d) to file a dozen complaints with constituent EU countries, arguing that Meta was contravening various aspects of the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \u2014 the legal framework which underpins EU Member States\u2019 national privacy laws (and also, still, the U.K.\u2019s Data Protection Act).\nThe complaints targeted Meta\u2019s use of an opt-in mechanism to authorize the processing versus an opt-out \u2014 arguing users should be asked their permission first, rather than having to take action to refuse a novel use of their information. Meta has said it\u2019s relying on a legal basis set out in the GDPR that\u2019s called \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI). It therefore contends its actions comply with the rules despite privacy experts\u2019 doubts that LI is an appropriate basis for such a use of people\u2019s data.\nMeta has sought to rely on this legal basis before to try to justify processing European users\u2019 information for microtargeted advertising. However, last year the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled it couldn\u2019t be used in that scenario, which raises doubts about Meta\u2019s bid to push AI training through the LI keyhole too.\nThat Meta has elected to kickstart its plans in the U.K., rather than the EU, is telling though, given that the U.K. is no longer part of the European Union. While U.K. data protection law does remain based on the GDPR, the ICO itself is no longer part of the same regulatory enforcement club and often pulls its punches on enforcement. U.K. lawmakers also recently toyed with deregulating the domestic privacy regime.\nOpt-out objections\nOne of the many bones of contention over Meta\u2019s approach the first time around was the process it provided for Facebook and Instagram users to \u201copt-out\u201d of their information being used to train its AIs.\nRather than giving people a straight \u201copt-in/out\u201d check-box, the company made users jump through hoops to find an objection form hidden behind multiple clicks or taps, at which point they were forced to state why they didn\u2019t want their data to be processed. They were also informed that it is entirely at Meta\u2019s discretion as to whether this request would be honored. Although the company claimed publicly that it would honor each request.\nFacebook \u201cobjection\u201d form. Image Credits: Meta / Screenshot\nThis time around, Meta is sticking with the objection form approach, meaning users will still have to formally apply to Meta to let them know that they don\u2019t want their data used to improve its AI systems. Those who have previously objected won\u2019t have to resubmit their objections, per Meta. But the company says it has made the objection form simpler this time around, incorporating feedback from the ICO. Although it hasn\u2019t yet explained how it\u2019s simpler. So, for now, all we have is Meta\u2019s claim that the process is easier.\nStephen Almond, ICO director of technology and innovation, said that it will \u201cmonitor the situation\u201d as Meta moves forward with its plans to use U.K. data for AI model training.\n\u201cIt is for Meta to ensure and demonstrate ongoing compliance with data protection law,\u201d Almond said in a statement. \u201cWe have been clear that any organisation using its users\u2019 information to train generative AI models [needs] to be transparent about how people\u2019s data is being used.
