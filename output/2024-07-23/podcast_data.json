Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday July 24), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAlphabet to invest another $5B into Waymo\ndescription0:\nAlphabet will spend an additional $5 billion on its self-driving subsidiary, Waymo, over the next few years, according to Ruth Porat, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.\nPorat announced the commitment to a new \u201cmulti-year investment\u201d Tuesday during Alphabet\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.\n\u201cThis new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels, will enable Waymo to continue to build the world\u2019s leading autonomous driving technology company,\u201d said Porat.\nPorat noted that Google will focus on improving overall efficiencies in its \u201cother bets\u201d segment, which includes innovative projects that are distinct from the tech giant\u2019s core search and advertising business. Other companies in this segment are Verily, Calico, Google Ventures and drone company Wing.\n\u201cWaymo is an important example of this, with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance,\u201d Porat continued.\nAlphabet has committed up to $5B to @Waymo. We are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we\u2019ve made with our technology, product, and commercialization efforts. \u2014 Tekedra N Mawakana (@TechTekedra) July 23, 2024\nThe executive noted that parent company Alphabet\u2019s 10-Q form, which has yet to be filed, will have more details.\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted on the call that Waymo is today delivering well over 50,000 paid rides per week, a number that Waymo also noted in a blog post last month. The self-driving company offers a fully driverless ride-hail service in San Francisco and Phoenix, and recently expanded to Los Angeles and Austin.\nTechCrunch reported last week that Waymo is ramping up efforts to gain access to lucrative SFO airport rides. The company already has the permits to operate its robotaxi service 24 hours a day in the city of San Francisco, parts of the Peninsula and the highways that reach the airport.\nLast month, Waymo opened up rides in San Francisco to any member of the public, doing away with its waitlist.\nWaymo also got the green light earlier this year to charge for rides in Los Angeles. As of July 1, Waymo is offering paid rider-only trips across a 63-square-mile area from Santa Monica to downtown LA. The company is also preparing to launch a commercial driverless service in Austin later this year.\nThis story was originally published at 2:27 p.m. PT. It has been updated to provide more context about Waymo\u2019s operations.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta releases its biggest 'open' AI model yet\ndescription1:\nMeta\u2019s latest open source AI model is its biggest yet.\nToday, Meta said it is releasing Llama 3.1 405B, a model containing 405 billion parameters. Parameters roughly correspond to a model\u2019s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.\nAt 405 billion parameters, Llama 3.1 405B isn\u2019t the absolute largest open source model out there, but it\u2019s the biggest in recent years. Trained using 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, it also benefits from newer training and development techniques that Meta claims makes it competitive with leading proprietary models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet (with a few caveats).\nAs with Meta\u2019s previous models, Llama 3.1 405B is available to download or use on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. It\u2019s also being used on WhatsApp and Meta.ai, where it\u2019s powering a chatbot experience for U.S.-based users.\nNew and improved\nLike other open and closed source generative AI models, Llama 3.1 405B can perform a range of different tasks, from coding and answering basic math questions to summarizing documents in eight languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish and Thai). It\u2019s text-only, meaning that it can\u2019t, for example, answer questions about an image, but most text-based workloads \u2014 think analyzing files like PDFs and spreadsheets \u2014 are within its purview.\nMeta wants to make it known that it is experimenting with multimodality. In a paper published today, researchers at the company write that they\u2019re actively developing Llama models that can recognize images and videos, and understand (and generate) speech. Still, these models aren\u2019t yet ready for public release.\nTo train Llama 3.1 405B, Meta used a dataset of 15 trillion tokens dating up to 2024 (tokens are parts of words that models can more easily internalize than whole words, and 15 trillion tokens translates to a mind-boggling 750 billion words). It\u2019s not a new training set per se, since Meta used the base set to train earlier Llama models, but the company claims it refined its curation pipelines for data and adopted \u201cmore rigorous\u201d quality assurance and data filtering approaches in developing this model.\nThe company also used synthetic data (data generated by other AI models) to fine-tune Llama 3.1 405B. Most major AI vendors, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are exploring applications of synthetic data to scale up their AI training, but some experts believe that synthetic data should be a last resort due to its potential to exacerbate model bias.\nFor its part, Meta insists that it \u201ccarefully balance[d]\u201d Llama 3.1 405B\u2019s training data, but declined to reveal exactly where the data came from (outside of webpages and public web files). Many generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and so keep it and any information pertaining to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive for companies to reveal much.\nImage Credits: Meta\nIn the aforementioned paper, Meta researchers wrote that compared to earlier Llama models, Llama 3.1 405B was trained on an increased mix of non-English data (to improve its performance on non-English languages), more \u201cmathematical data\u201d and code (to improve the model\u2019s mathematical reasoning skills), and recent web data (to bolster its knowledge of current events).\nRecent reporting by Reuters revealed that Meta at one point used copyrighted e-books for AI training despite its own lawyers\u2019 warnings. The company controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts, photos and captions, and makes it difficult for users to opt out. What\u2019s more, Meta, along with OpenAI, is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, over the companies\u2019 alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for model training.\n\u201cThe training data, in many ways, is sort of like the secret recipe and the sauce that goes into building these models,\u201d Ragavan Srinivasan, VP of AI program management at Meta, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cAnd so from our perspective, we\u2019ve invested a lot in this. And it is going to be one of these things where we will continue to refine it.\u201d\nLlama 3.1 405B has a larger context window than previous Llama models: 128,000 tokens, or roughly the length of a 50-page book. A model\u2019s context, or context window, refers to the input data (e.g. text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g. additional text).\nOne of the advantages of models with larger contexts is that they can summarize longer text snippets and files. When powering chatbots, such models are also less likely to forget topics that were recently discussed.\nTwo other new, smaller models Meta unveiled today, Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B \u2014 updated versions of the company\u2019s Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B models released in April \u2014 also have 128,000-token context windows. The previous models\u2019 contexts topped out at 8,000 tokens, which makes this upgrade fairly substantial \u2014 assuming the new Llama models can effectively reason across all that context.\nImage Credits: Meta\nAll of the Llama 3.1 models can use third-party tools, apps and APIs to complete tasks, like rival models from Anthropic and OpenAI. Out of the box, they\u2019re trained to tap Brave Search to answer questions about recent events, the Wolfram Alpha API for math- and science-related queries, and a Python interpreter for validating code. In addition, Meta claims the Llama 3.1 models can use certain tools they haven\u2019t seen before \u2014 to an extent.\nBuilding an ecosystem\nIf benchmarks are to be believed (not that benchmarks are the end-all be-all in generative AI), Llama 3.1 405B is a very capable model indeed. That\u2019d be a good thing, considering some of the painfully obvious limitations of previous-generation Llama models.\nLlama 3 405B performs on par with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, and achieves \u201cmixed results\u201d compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, per human evaluators that Meta hired, the paper notes. While Llama 3 405B is better at executing code and generating plots than GPT-4o, its multilingual capabilities are overall weaker, and Llama 3 405B trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in programming and general reasoning.\nAnd because of its size, it needs beefy hardware to run. Meta recommends at least a server node.\nThat\u2019s perhaps why Meta\u2019s pushing its smaller new models, Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B, for general-purpose applications like powering chatbots and generating code. Llama 3.1 405B, the company says, is better reserved for model distillation \u2014 the process of transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller, more efficient model \u2014 and generating synthetic data to train (or fine-tune) alternative models.\nTo encourage the synthetic data use case, Meta said it has updated Llama\u2019s license to let developers use outputs from the Llama 3.1 model family to develop third-party AI generative models (whether that\u2019s a wise idea is up for debate). Importantly, the license still constrains how developers can deploy Llama models: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion.\nImage Credits: Meta\nThat change in licensing around outputs, which allays a major criticism of Meta\u2019s models within the AI community, is a part of the company\u2019s aggressive push for mindshare in generative AI.\nAlongside the Llama 3.1 family, Meta is releasing what it\u2019s calling a \u201creference system\u201d and new safety tools \u2014 several of these block prompts that might cause Llama models to behave in unpredictable or undesirable ways \u2014 to encourage developers to use Llama in more places. The company is also previewing and seeking comment on the Llama Stack, a forthcoming API for tools that can be used to fine-tune Llama models, generate synthetic data with Llama and build \u201cagentic\u201d applications \u2014 apps powered by Llama that can take action on a user\u2019s behalf.\n\u201c[What] We have heard repeatedly from developers is an interest in learning how to actually deploy [Llama models] in production,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to start giving them a bunch of different tools and options.\u201d\nPlay for market share\nIn an open letter published this morning, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lays out a vision for the future in which AI tools and models reach the hands of more developers around the world, ensuring people have access to the \u201cbenefits and opportunities\u201d of AI.\nIt\u2019s couched very philanthropically, but implicit in the letter is Zuckerberg\u2019s desire that these tools and models be of Meta\u2019s making.\nMeta\u2019s racing to catch up to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, and it is employing a tried-and-true strategy: give tools away for free to foster an ecosystem and then slowly add products and services, some paid, on top. Spending billions of dollars on models that it can then commoditize also has the effect of driving down Meta competitors\u2019 prices and spreading the company\u2019s version of AI broadly. It also lets the company incorporate improvements from the open source community into its future models.\nLlama certainly has developers\u2019 attention. Meta claims Llama models have been downloaded over 300 million times, and more than 20,000 Llama-derived models have been created so far.\nMake no mistake, Meta\u2019s playing for keeps. It is spending millions on lobbying regulators to come around to its preferred flavor of \u201copen\u201d generative AI. None of the Llama 3.1 models solve the intractable problems with today\u2019s generative AI tech, like its tendency to make things up and regurgitate problematic training data. But they do advance one of Meta\u2019s key goals: becoming synonymous with generative AI.\nThere are costs to this. In the research paper, the co-authors \u2014 echoing Zuckerberg\u2019s recent comments \u2014 discuss energy-related reliability issues with training Meta\u2019s ever-growing generative AI models.\n\u201cDuring training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time, for example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup or shutdown of the entire training job,\u201d they write. \u201cWhen this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power consumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid. This is an ongoing challenge for us as we scale training for future, even larger Llama models.\u201d\nOne hopes that training those larger models won\u2019t force more utilities to keep old coal-burning power plants around.\n\ntitle2:\nElon Musk sets new date for Tesla robotaxi reveal, calls everything beyond autonomy 'noise'\ndescription2:\nElon Musk says he will show off Tesla\u2019s purpose-built \u201crobotaxi\u201d prototype during an event October 10, after scrapping a previous plan to reveal it August 8. Musk said Tesla will also show off \u201ca couple of other things,\u201d but didn\u2019t explain what that meant.\nThe comments, made on Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call Tuesday, largely confirms Bloomberg\u2019s original report about the delay, including that it was driven by Musk\u2019s desire to redesign certain elements of the prototype. Musk confirmed earlier this month that he requested an \u201cimportant design change to the front.\u201d\n\u201cMoving it back a few months allowed us to improve the robotaxi, as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil,\u201d Musk said during the call.\nThe Tesla robotaxi \u2014 and the \u201cunsupervised\u201d full self-driving software that Musk says will run them \u2014 is at the center of the company\u2019s future. Earlier this year, he laid off more than 10% of Tesla\u2019s global staff in a bid to reorganize the company toward developing artificial intelligence-powered products, including a \u201cballs to the wall\u201d push toward developing autonomy.\nThat AI-focused future is bumping up against the company\u2019s primary profit center of selling EVs, though. Tesla reported Tuesday that it made $1.5 billion in profit for the second quarter of 2024, down 45% from the same period last year. That profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales, too, though Tesla reported a $622 million restructuring charge that dragged down its earnings. And while total revenues were up 2% year-over-year, automotive revenues dropped 7% to $19.9 billion.\nThis performance follows what was already a rough start to the year for Tesla, where it saw a 55% year-over-year drop in profit in the first quarter.\nThe company is now looking at a real possibility of selling fewer EVs in 2024 than it did in 2023, which would represent a stunning reversal of its prior growth trajectory. Tesla has massaged this by telling investors that it is between \u201ctwo major growth waves,\u201d pinning hopes of more sales on the new (but polarizing and expensive) Cybertruck, and mysterious future models that could be sold at a lower MSRP.\nThat\u2019s all \u201cin the noise,\u201d though, according to Musk. Tesla\u2019s long-term value lies in autonomy and autonomy alone, he stressed on Tuesday\u2019s call. That includes the company\u2019s humanoid robot effort, dubbed Optimus, which got a sneaky delay this week. But it mostly centers around Musk\u2019s longest running promise that he has yet to deliver on: self-driving cars.\nWith that in mind, Musk tried to focus investors\u2019 attention to the October 10 event. Not much is publicly known about what Tesla will show off, though there was an illustration of a small robotaxi prototype in the biography of Musk written by Walter Isaacson in 2023.\nMusk has spoken about making the vehicle available to people through Tesla\u2019s app, similar to how Uber and Lyft operate. He\u2019s also claimed Tesla owners will be able to put their own cars on the shared network once the company makes its Full Self-Driving software advanced enough to handle all driving \u2014 something it is still far from accomplishing, despite the name.\nDespite years of promises, Musk has struggled to execute on the idea of fully self-driving cars, and as a result Tesla is being sued by owners and investigated by numerous government agencies.\nAsked on the call when Tesla would be able to offer its first unsupervised robotaxi ride, Musk said he believes it could be possible by the end of this year. But he added that it also could happen in 2025, and that he is \u201coverly optimistic\u201d with his predictions.\nThis story has been updated with more details from Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. The article originally published at 2:45 p.m. PT.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI-backed legal tech startup Harvey raises $100M\ndescription3:\nHarvey, a startup building what it describes as an AI-powered \u201ccopilot\u201d for lawyers, has raised $100 million in a Series C round led by GV, Google\u2019s corporate venture arm.\nThe tranche, which also had participation from heavy-hitting angels and VCs OpenAI, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil and SV Angel, brings Harvey\u2019s total raised to $206 million and values the firm at $1.5 billion.\nIn a post on Tuesday on Harvey\u2019s official blog, co-founders Winston Weinberg and Gabriel Pereyra said that the bulk of the new capital will be put toward collecting and curating data to build and train \u201cdomain-specific\u201d AI models while growing Harvey\u2019s headcount and expanding its paid services to new geographies.\n\u201cThis investment will enable Harvey to continue scaling and improving our AI-powered technology across business functions and geographies,\u201d Weinberg and Pereyra said. \u201cWe will use this new capital to invest in the engineering, data and domain expertise that are fundamental to building AI-native systems that facilitate the most complex knowledge work. We will also deepen our partnerships with both cloud and model providers to integrate additional models into Harvey and broaden our training collaborations to continue improving model efficacy.\u201d\nWeinberg, a former securities and antitrust litigator at law firm O\u2019Melveny & Myers, and Pereyra, previously a research scientist at DeepMind, Google Brain (another of Google\u2019s AI groups) and Meta AI, launched San Francisco-based Harvey in 2022. Weinberg and Pereyra are roommates; Pereyra showed Weinberg OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 text-generating system and Weinberg realized that it could be used to improve legal workflows.\nHarvey, powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model family, can answer legal questions phrased in natural language, like \u201cTell me what the differences are between an employee and independent contractor in the Fourth Circuit\u201d and \u201cTell me if this clause in a lease is in violation of California law, and if so, rewrite it so it is no longer in violation.\u201d Harvey also offers tools that can automatically extract information from trial transcripts, automatically find legal documents that can back up court arguments and generate first drafts of filings that incorporate info and citations from legal databases.\nIt\u2019s powerful stuff in theory. But it\u2019s also fraught. Given the sensitive nature of most legal disputes, some lawyers and law firms might be reluctant to give a tool like Harvey access to any case documents. There\u2019s also the matter of language models\u2019 proclivity to spout toxicity and made-up facts, which would be particularly poorly received \u2014 if not perjurious \u2014 in a court of law.\nThat\u2019s why Harvey has a disclaimer attached to it: The tool isn\u2019t meant to provide legal advice to nonlawyers and should be used under the supervision of licensed attorneys.\nHarvey faces some competition. Casetext uses AI, primarily OpenAI models, to find legal cases and assist with general legal research tasks and brief drafting. More surgical tools like Klarity use AI to strip drudgery from contract review. At one point in time, startup Augrented was even exploring ways to leverage OpenAI models to summarize legal notices or other sources in plain language to help apartment tenants defend their rights.\nBut Weinberg and Pereyra claim that Harvey is flying high and in use \u201cdaily\u201d by tens of thousands of lawyers at law firms and consultancies, including Allen & Overy, Macfarlanes, Ashurst, CMS, Reed Smith and PwC. Annual recurring revenue has tripled since last December, the two co-founders said in the blog post, while Harvey\u2019s workforce has tripled in size.\nThe Information reported in early June that Harvey hoped to raise $600 million at \u201cat least\u201d a $2 billion valuation, in part to acquire a legal research service called vLex to train its AI products. Those plans fell through \u2014 hence the vastly reduced Series C.\n\ntitle4:\nDigital banking startup Mercury abruptly shuttered service for startups in Ukraine, Nigeria, other countries\ndescription4:\nDigital banking startup Mercury is no longer serving customers in certain countries, including Ukraine, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.\nMercury made headlines earlier this year when it was caught up in federal scrutiny through one of its partners, Choice Bank, around the practice of allowing foreign companies to open accounts.\nThe FDIC was \u201cconcerned\u201d that Choice \u201chad opened Mercury accounts in legally risky countries,\u201d the Information reported. Officials also reportedly chastised Choice for letting overseas Mercury customers \u201copen thousands of accounts using questionable methods to prove they had a presence in the U.S.\u201d\nMercury told TechCrunch in April that it was investing in its risk and compliance teams. In an apparent response to that federal scrutiny and as part of the company\u2019s \u201congoing commitment to compliance,\u201d a Mercury spokesperson told TechCrunch on Monday that it recently updated its eligibility requirements and notified certain customers that it could \u201cno longer support them due to either the address(es) they provided or the locations where we recorded frequent account activity.\u201d\nSome of those countries on the will-not-support list are not surprising: North Korea, Iran, Libya, Russia. (A full list can be found here.) But Ukraine is also now on the list, a country that was known for its robust-and-growing startup community, particularly before Russia invaded.\nMercury said its change in policy only applies to founders living in the country, not founders living in the U.S. with a Ukrainian passport, responding to an earlier report by Ukrainian founder Alyona Mysko, CEO and founder of Fuelfinance. Mysko posted on LinkedIn on Monday that Mercury closed her company\u2019s bank account \u201cbecause I hold a Ukrainian passport!\u201d\nA Mercury spokesperson said that it does, and continues to, support founders with Ukrainian passports located in the United States but changed its policy to no longer support \u201ccompanies with founders located in Ukraine.\u201d\nBut the spokesperson also admitted to TechCrunch that it did, initially, say that it was banning founders with Ukrainian passports and later revised that, calling it an \u201cerror.\u201d\n\u201cWe made an error in our help center article which incorrectly said we could not support founders with a Ukrainian passport,\u201d the spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nMysko told TechCrunch that she wrote to Mercury CEO Immad Akhund via LinkedIn and email, asking him to explain the situation. Mysko said she\u2019s now concerned that this situation is not restricted to just Mercury and is worried that it\u2019s emblematic of \u201ca problem in the whole banking system where banks don\u2019t differentiate Ukraine from Russia.\u201d\nThe FDIC told TechCrunch that fintechs like Mercury are not under its direct jurisdiction but did not answer our questions on whether its guidance on Ukraine had changed.\nMercury explains why it banned Ukraine\nMercury explained its decision to include Ukraine in its list of banned countries by saying it has become \u201ctoo complex\u201d to support the country, given current U.S. sanctions programs.\n\u201cWhile Ukraine is not comprehensively sanctioned, several regions of Ukraine are sanctioned. We previously applied a region-based model to support as many customers in Ukraine as possible; however supporting this policy while also upholding our rigorous standards on compliance has become increasingly complex,\u201d a Mercury spokesperson said, and promised to \u201crevisit\u201d the policy in the future.\nWhen asked what Fuelfinance was doing for a bank account, Mysko said the company secured a second bank account at Chase following the decline of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\nShe also referred to a similar X post by Ukraine-based Lemon.io CEO Aleksandr Volodarsky from Monday that referenced Mercury, saying, \u201cAs a founder, you are going to eat s*** all the time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cToday on my menu is @mercury throwing customers under the bus. As a founder to founder, @immad, thanks, dude, that\u2019s some tasty s***.\u201d\nMysko said she received a response from Mercury, but the startup is not going to reinstate her company as a customer. Mercury co-founder Jason Zhang also responded to her via email, which she posted on LinkedIn, and said he agreed how unfair this situation is to founders in Ukraine; however, \u201cit\u2019s an unfortunate reality that we can\u2019t support founders located in Ukraine right now.\u201d\nHe went on to say that the company doesn\u2019t put Ukraine \u201cin the same category as Russia.\u201d He also said that in managing Mercury\u2019s compliance and risk, and the U.S. sanctions against regions of Ukraine, \u201cthere are commonalities in the controls and systems we have to put in place.\u201d\nNigerian founders in the U.S. were also impacted\nUkraine is not the only country impacted. Mercury has also included Croatia and Nigeria on its list.\nTwo Nigerian founders living in the U.S. narrated similar experiences to TechCrunch. According to the founders, who asked not to be named, Mercury will close their accounts in the next 30 days despite their startups being domiciled in the U.S. It\u2019s unclear if Mercury is using passports, rather than local addresses, in making such decisions. In an updated policy, Mercury said, \u201cIf you are domiciled outside of one of these countries, please reach out to support@mercury.com for assistance in opening your account.\u201d\nFor the founders in Nigeria, this isn\u2019t their first rodeo with Mercury. In 2022, Mercury restricted almost 30 accounts linked to tech startups in Nigeria and other African countries, most of which had already gone through U.S.-based accelerators, including Y Combinator and Techstars.\nNigeria and some affected countries on Mercury\u2019s list, including Croatia, are on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \u201cgrey list,\u201d which means they\u2019re subject to additional scrutiny because of deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.\nRegarding the recent development, Benjamin Dada, a fintech partnerships expert from Nigeria, told TechCrunch: \u201cBut a customer from Nigeria is not on the same level as a customer from Iran or North Korea, risk-wise. Because they\u2019ve failed to put in place the right compliance infrastructure which gets their banking partners, and the partner bank\u2019s regulators, comfortable, they are having to do a bulk pruning of their customer base to show that they are now more conservative in customer onboarding.\u201d\nAfrican fintechs, including Raenest, Verto and Leatherback, that provide U.S. accounts to businesses will look to seize this opportunity and take in some of the affected customers.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time African businesses have been threatened with service disruption by the likes of Mercury, Wise. For us, Africa was on the table from the get-go from partnership to compliance, and not slotted in at the end of the conversation,\u201d Raenest co-founder Richard Oyome told TechCrunch.\nGeek Ventures managing partner Ihar Mahaniok also posted on X, advising founders with Mercury accounts to open another account just in case. And to founders in general, \u201cWe do not recommend opening an account in Mercury; they have proven they are not a reliable bank. Thankfully, there are plenty of better options around.\u201d\nMercury responded to Mahaniok\u2019s post with the same statement it sent TechCrunch about why it has changed its policy regarding Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, Mercury competitor Brex is helping venture-backed Ukrainian founders who lost their accounts. Account holders get a 50,000-point sign-up bonus after depositing $500,000 into a Brex business account and an additional 25,000-point sign-up bonus after spending $10,000 via their Brex card.\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Szkutak.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?
