Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The company raised $410 million at an implied valuation of just over $6 billion. Its early gains took the company to a valuation as high as $7 billion, but it closed its first day of trading up nearly 9%, for a market cap of roughly $6.65 billion.\nTempus believes that AI can help guide therapy selection and treatment decisions, in conjunction with the patient's doctor. It generated total revenue of $531.8 million in 2023 and a net loss of $214.1 million.\n\"We're on a really good trajectory,\" Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Friday morning before shares started trading. \"As revenues have been growing quickly, we're not investing all that gross profit dollar growth back into the business. We're generating improved leverage every quarter,\" he said, adding that he expects the company to be both cash flow and EBITDA positive within the next year.\n\ntitle1:\nApple and Meta could face charges for violating EU tech rules\ndescription1:\nApple and Meta could soon face charges from the European Commission for violating Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules. The Financial Times reported Friday that the Commission is planning to charge Apple, and Reuters reported later that Meta could be charged as well.\nThe Commission is reported to be targeting Apple over its \u201csteering\u201d rules that charge developers for pointing to third-party purchase options. Meta\u2019s charges will reportedly revolve around its ad-free subscription for Facebook and Instagram in the EU.\nThe Commission will be issuing preliminary findings, according to Reuters, meaning that the companies can make changes to try and correct things before the Commission makes a final decision. Apple is set to be charged first, Reuters reports, and the FT says we could see the charges in the coming weeks.\nThe European Commission and Apple didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta pauses plans to train AI using European users' data, bowing to regulatory pressure\ndescription2:\nMeta has confirmed that it will pause plans to start training its AI systems using data from its users in the European Union and U.K.\nThe move follows pushback from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), Meta\u2019s lead regulator in the EU, which is acting on behalf of several data protection authorities across the bloc. The U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) also requested that Meta pause its plans until it could satisfy concerns it had raised.\n\u201cThe DPC welcomes the decision by Meta to pause its plans to train its large language model using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram across the EU/EEA,\u201d the DPC said in a statement Friday. \u201cThis decision followed intensive engagement between the DPC and Meta. The DPC, in cooperation with its fellow EU data protection authorities, will continue to engage with Meta on this issue.\u201d\nWhile Meta is already tapping user-generated content to train its AI in markets such as the U.S., Europe\u2019s stringent GDPR regulations has created obstacles for Meta \u2014 and other companies \u2014 looking to improve their AI systems, including large language models with user-generated training material.\nHowever, Meta last month began notifying users of an upcoming change to its privacy policy, one that it said will give it the right to use public content on Facebook and Instagram to train its AI, including content from comments, interactions with companies, status updates, photos and their associated captions. The company argued that it needed to do this to reflect \u201cthe diverse languages, geography and cultural references of the people in Europe.\u201d\nThese changes were due to come into effect on June 26 \u2014 12 days from now. But the plans spurred not-for-profit privacy activist organization NOYB (\u201cnone of your business\u201d) to file 11 complaints with constituent EU countries, arguing that Meta is contravening various facets of GDPR. One of those relates to the issue of opt-in versus opt-out, vis \u00e0 vis where personal data processing does take place, users should be asked their permission first rather than requiring action to refuse.\nMeta, for its part, was relying on a GDPR provision called \u201clegitimate interests\u201d to contend that its actions were compliant with the regulations. This isn\u2019t the first time Meta has used this legal basis in defense, having previously done so to justify processing European users\u2019 for targeted advertising.\nIt always seemed likely that regulators would at least put a stay of execution on Meta\u2019s planned changes, particularly given how difficult the company had made it for users to \u201copt out\u201d of having their data used. The company said that it sent out more than 2 billion notifications informing users of the upcoming changes, but unlike other important public messaging that are plastered to the top of users\u2019 feeds, such as prompts to go out and vote, these notifications appeared alongside users\u2019 standard notifications: friends\u2019 birthdays, photo tag alerts, group announcements and more. So if someone doesn\u2019t regularly check their notifications, it was all too easy to miss this.\nAnd those who did see the notification wouldn\u2019t automatically know that there was a way to object or opt-out, as it simply invited users to click through to find out how Meta will use their information. There was nothing to suggest that there was a choice here.\nMeta: AI notification Image Credits: Meta\nMoreover, users technically weren\u2019t able to \u201copt out\u201d of having their data used. Instead, they had to complete an objection form where they put forward their arguments for why they didn\u2019t want their data to be processed \u2014 it was entirely at Meta\u2019s discretion as to whether this request was honored, though the company said it would honor each request.\nFacebook \u201cobjection\u201d form Image Credits: Meta / Screenshot\nAlthough the objection form was linked from the notification itself, anyone proactively looking for the objection form in their account settings had their work cut out.\nOn Facebook\u2019s website, they had to first click their profile photo at the top-right; hit settings & privacy; tap privacy center; scroll down and click on the Generative AI at Meta section; scroll down again past a bunch of links to a section titled more resources. The first link under this section is called \u201cHow Meta uses information for Generative AI models,\u201d and they needed to read through some 1,100 words before getting to a discrete link to the company\u2019s \u201cright to object\u201d form. It was a similar story in the Facebook mobile app.\nLink to \u201cright to object\u201d form Image Credits: Meta / Screenshot\nEarlier this week, when asked why this process required the user to file an objection rather than opt-in, Meta\u2019s policy communications manager Matt Pollard pointed TechCrunch to its existing blog post, which says: \u201cWe believe this legal basis [\u201clegitimate interests\u201d] is the most appropriate balance for processing public data at the scale necessary to train AI models, while respecting people\u2019s rights.\u201d\nTo translate this, making this opt-in likely wouldn\u2019t generate enough \u201cscale\u201d in terms of people willing to offer their data. So the best way around this was to issue a solitary notification in amongst users\u2019 other notifications; hide the objection form behind half-a-dozen clicks for those seeking the \u201copt-out\u201d independently; and then make them justify their objection, rather than give them a straight opt-out.\nIn an updated blog post Friday, Meta\u2019s global engagement director for privacy policy Stefano Fratta said that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the request it has received from the DPC.\n\u201cThis is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe,\u201d Fratta wrote. \u201cWe remain highly confident that our approach complies with European laws and regulations. AI training is not unique to our services, and we\u2019re more transparent than many of our industry counterparts.\u201d\nAI arms race\nNone of this is new, and Meta is in an AI arms race that has shone a giant spotlight on the vast arsenal of data Big Tech holds on all of us.\nEarlier this year, Reddit revealed that it\u2019s contracted to make north of $200 million in the coming years for licensing its data to companies such as ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Google. And the latter of those companies is already facing huge fines for leaning on copyrighted news content to train its generative AI models.\nBut these efforts also highlight the lengths to which companies will go to ensure that they can leverage this data within the constrains of existing legislation; \u201copting in\u201d is rarely on the agenda, and the process of opting out is often needlessly arduous. Just last month, someone spotted some dubious wording in an existing Slack privacy policy that suggested it would be able to leverage user data for training its AI systems, with users able to opt out only by emailing the company.\nAnd last year, Google finally gave online publishers a way to opt their websites out of training its models by enabling them to inject a piece of code into their sites. OpenAI, for its part, is building a dedicated tool to allow content creators to opt out of training its generative AI smarts; this should be ready by 2025.\nWhile Meta\u2019s attempts to train its AI on users\u2019 public content in Europe is on ice for now, it likely will rear its head again in another form after consultation with the DPC and ICO \u2014 hopefully with a different user-permission process in tow.\n\u201cIn order to get the most out of generative AI and the opportunities it brings, it is crucial that the public can trust that their privacy rights will be respected from the outset,\u201d Stephen Almond, the ICO\u2019s executive director for regulatory risk, said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe will continue to monitor major developers of generative AI, including Meta, to review the safeguards they have put in place and ensure the information rights of U.K. users are protected.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nElon Musk says Optimus robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company\ndescription3:\nA mockup of Tesla Inc.'s planned humanoid robot Optimus on display during the Seoul Mobility Show in Goyang, South Korea, on Thursday, March 30, 2023. The motor show will continue through April 9. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nThe entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed Thursday that his company's Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.\nMusk, who characterized himself as \"pathologically optimistic\" at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a \"new chapter\" in its life, but is about to write an entirely \"new book.\" Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.\nTesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard who looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.\nIn January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.\nAt the shareholder event Thursday, Musk didn't divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in \"Star Wars.\" They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.\nAs for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion someday.\nSpeaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into \"limited production\" of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.\nThe company, he predicted, will have \"over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla\" in 2025.\nThis is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don't pan out \u2014 from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.\nGetting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple's value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world's biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft .\nAt Thursday's close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.\nMusk didn't provide a time frame for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft to delay launch of AI Recall tool due to security concerns\ndescription4:\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on May 21, 2024.\nMicrosoft will no longer ship Recall, an artificial intelligence tool that tracks user activity, when the company releases the Copilot+ PC next week, it announced in a blog post on Thursday following concerns about privacy and security.\nThe company wrote that Recall will shift from being a \"broadly available\" tool to a preview feature available only through the Windows Insiders Program, or WIP, when the new computer is released on June 18. Microsoft plans to make the AI feature available on all Copilot+ PCs soon after they receive feedback through WIP.\n\"This decision is rooted in our commitment to providing a trusted, secure and robust experience for all customers,\" Windows Corporate Vice President Pavan Davuluri wrote in the blog post.\nMicrosoft first introduced the Copilot+ PC on May 20 as a computer designed to run advanced AI programs, including Recall. Recall is an AI tool that regularly takes screenshots to create a record of activity, allowing users to search for their previous actions.\nRecall became a source of controversy soon after it was announced. Industry experts have expressed concern over the potential for hackers to develop tools that can retrieve user information, including usernames and passwords.\nIn response to the backlash, Microsoft initially announced that the Recall feature would be turned off by default, requiring users to opt in. The company also implemented additional security protections, including an encrypted search database and a requirement that Recall users enroll in Windows Hello, which has users prove their identity through a PIN, fingerprint or facial recognition.\nMicrosoft's decision to delay Recall follows heightened concerns around security as the AI field evolves rapidly. Last month, a U.S. government review board criticized the company's handling of China's breach of U.S. government officials' email accounts.\"\n\nResponse:",
