 Alphabet stock up on strong earnings, first-ever dividend, buyback
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai during the Google I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California, on May 10, 2023.
Alphabet shares shot up 10% on Friday after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter results and greenlit its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion buyback.
It's the sharpest rally for the stock since a 16% jump in July 2015. The shares closed the day at $171.95, valuing Alphabet at over $2.1 trillion.
The company on Thursday reported revenue of $80.54 billion, a 15% increase from a year earlier and the fastest growth rate since early 2022, surpassing the $78.59 billion in sales expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Earnings of $1.89 per share eclipsed the $1.51 in earnings per share expected by Wall Street.
Alphabet announced that its board authorized a dividend of 20 cents per share to be paid on June 17 to all shareholders of record as of June 10, and said it intends to pay future quarterly cash dividends. The company said the board also approved the repurchase of an additional $70 billion in stock.
The company exceeded analysts' expectations for YouTube advertising revenue and Google Cloud revenue.
Barclays analysts maintained an overweight rating on Alphabet stock and lifted their price target to $200 from $173, lauding the company's balancing of investment with efficiency and capital returns.
"Google is in the sweet spot of accelerating growth, expanding margins while shipping product faster, and returning capital — basically proving the naysayers wrong," they wrote in a Thursday note. "The momentum should stay strong for a while here."
Analysts at Oppenheimer keyed in on Alphabet's accelerating advertising business despite its substantial spending on artificial intelligence, raising their price target to $205 from $185 and reiterating an outperform rating.
Morgan Stanley analysts, retaining their overweight rating of Alphabet, hiked their price target to $195 from $165, citing the company's core growth durability and "early success durably reengineering the cost base."
Among other price target boosts for the stock following Alphabet's earnings, JPMorgan increased its price target to $200 from $165, while Evercore ISI upped its target to $200 from $160.

Snap shares rocket 28% as company reports unexpected profit
A view of the atmosphere during the Snap Partner Summit 2023 at Barker Hangar on April 19, 2023 in Santa Monica, California.
Snap shares surged 28% on Friday after the company surprised Wall Street by showing a profit and reported sales and user numbers that exceeded analysts' estimates.
The stock climbed $3.15 to close at $14.55, its biggest percentage gain since 2022. Even after the rally, the stock is down 14% for the year due to a 31% plunge in February.
Revenue in the first quarter increased 21% to $1.19 billion from $989 million a year earlier, topping analysts' estimates for sales of $1.12 billion, according to LSEG.
The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 3 cents, while analysts were expecting a 5-cent loss. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $46 million, compared to analysts' expectations for a loss of $68 million.
Snap said adjusted EBITDA "exceeded our expectations" and was primarily driven by operating expense discipline, as well as accelerating revenue growth.
Snap has been working to rebuild its advertising business after the digital ad market stumbled in 2022. Its investments are starting to pay off. The company said in its investor letter that revenue growth was primarily driven by improvements in the advertising platform, as well as demand for its direct-response advertising solutions.
"I think more broadly, we saw a much more robust brand environment, which played out in all of our regions in Q1," CFO Derek Andersen said on the earnings call.
User growth was also better than expected. Snap reported 422 million daily active users (DAUs) in the first quarter, up 10% year over year and topping the average analyst estimate of 420 million, according to StreetAccount.
In February, Snap announced it would lay off 10% of its global workforce, or around 500 employees. The company said Thursday that headcount and personnel costs will "grow modestly" through the rest of the year.
Advertising revenue came in at $1.11 billion in the first quarter. Snap's "Other Revenue" category, which is primarily driven by Snapchat+ subscribers, reached $87 million, an increase of 194% year over year. Snap reported more than 9 million Snapchat+ subscribers for the period.
Though Snap's growth was its fastest since March 2022, it still fell behind that of Meta, which reported 27% growth in its better-than-expected first-quarter results on Wednesday. Meta shares plunged anyway after the company issued a light forecast and spooked investors with talk of its long-term investments.
For the second quarter, Snap expects to report revenue between $1.23 billion and $1.26 billion, up from the $1.22 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Microsoft says cloud AI demand exceeds supply despite spending surge
Amy Hood, chief financial officer at Microsoft, speaks during a presentation on affordable housing in Bellevue, Washington, on Jan. 17, 2019.
Microsoft is increasing spending at a rate not seen since at least 2016. It still might not be enough.
In its earnings report on Thursday, Microsoft said capital expenditures jumped 79% from a year earlier to $14 billion. The company is spending much faster than it's increasing revenue — sales climbed 17% in the period.
Even with all that investment, Microsoft has a shortage of data center infrastructure, specifically for deploying artificial intelligence models.
"We do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts on the company's earnings call.
Companies need an ever-increasing amount of computing power to run hefty workloads, adding human-like generative AI features to their products. It's a boom that was kicked off by OpenAI and its ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft has followed suit, adding assistants to the Teams communication app, Bing search engine and other services. The technology can summarize meeting transcripts, compose emails, and explain information from the web.
Microsoft isn't the only AI hardware vendor with a supply challenge.
Nvidia , the biggest developer of processors for training and deploying generative AI models, has been supply-constrained, with revenue more than tripling in consecutive quarters. Now Microsoft, one of Nvidia's major customers, is feeling the stress.
During the fiscal third quarter, revenue in Microsoft's Azure cloud rose 31%, with 7 percentage points from AI. Hood said the capacity issue might have affected AI results and will have an impact in the fiscal fourth quarter. A supply limitation means Microsoft has less available capacity to rent out to clients for deploying AI models at the inference stage, she said.
Azure is key to Microsoft's future, contributing tens of billions of dollars in revenue every quarter and growing faster than most other parts of the company. Within Azure, AI services stand out as a highlight, attracting new clients as Microsoft goes up against Amazon Web Services.
Hood said capital expenditures will increase "materially" in the current quarter, mainly for cloud infrastructure. And she called for higher capital expenditures in the new fiscal year, beginning July 1.
Microsoft intends "to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products," she said.

U.S. chipmaker Intel was once dominant, now struggles to stay relevant

Intel's long-awaited turnaround looks farther away than ever after the company reported dismal first-quarter earnings. Investors pushed the shares down 9% on Friday to their lowest level of the year. Although Intel's revenue is no longer shrinking and the company remains the biggest maker of processors that power PCs and laptops, sales in the first quarter trailed estimates. Intel also gave a soft forecast for the second quarter, suggesting weak demand. It was a tough showing for CEO Pat Gelsinger, who's early in his fourth year at the helm. But Intel's problems are decades in the making. Before Gelsinger returned to the company in 2021, the company, once synonymous with "Silicon Valley," had lost its edge in semiconductor manufacturing to overseas rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . Now, in a high-risk quest, it's spending billions per quarter to regain ground. "Job number one was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment," Gelsinger told investors on Thursday. He said the company is still on track to catch up by 2026. Investors remain skeptical. Intel is the worst-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 this year, down 37%. Meanwhile, the two best-performing stocks in the index are chipmaker Nvidia and Super Micro Computer , which has been boosted by surging demand for Nvidia-based artificial intelligence servers. Intel, long the most valuable U.S. chipmaker, is now one-sixteenth the size of Nvidia by market cap. It's also smaller than Qualcomm , Broadcom , Texas Instruments , and AMD . For decades, it was the largest semiconductor company in the world by sales, but suffered seven straight quarters of revenue declines recently, and was passed by Nvidia last year. Gelsinger is betting on a risky business model change. Not only will Intel make its own branded processors, but it will act as a factory for other chip companies that outsource their manufacturing — a group of companies that includes Nvidia, Apple , and Qualcomm. Its success acquiring customers will depend on Intel regaining "process leadership," as the company calls it. Other semiconductor companies would like an alternative to TSMC so they don't have to rely on a single supplier. U.S. political leaders including President Biden call Intel an American chip champion and say the company is strategically an important part of the U.S. processor supply chain. "Intel is a big, iconic semiconductor company which has been the leader for many years," said Nicholas Brathwaite, managing partner at Celesta Capital, which invests in semiconductor companies. "And I think it's a company that is worth trying to save, and they have to come back to competitiveness." But the chipmaker isn't doing itself any favors. "I think everyone has been hearing them say the next quarter will be better for two, three years now," said Counterpoint analyst Akshara Bassi. Intel has fumbled the ball for years. It missed the mobile chip boom with the unveiling of the iPhone in 2007. It's also been largely on the sidelines of the AI craze while companies like Meta , Microsoft and Google order as many Nvidia chips as they can. Here's how Intel ended up where it is today.
Missed out on the iPhone

The iPhone could have had an Intel chip inside. When Apple developed the first iPhone, then-CEO Steve Jobs visited former Intel CEO Paul Otellini, according to Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography "Steve Jobs." They discussed whether Intel should power the iPhone, which had not been released yet, Jobs and Otellini told Isaacson. When the iPhone was first revealed, it was marketed as a phone that ran the Apple Mac operating system. It would've made sense to use Intel chips, which ran on the best desktops at the time, including Apple's Macs. Jobs said that Apple passed on Intel's chips because the company was "slow" and Apple didn't want the same chips to be sold to its competitors. Otellini said that while the tie-up would have made sense, the two companies couldn't agree on a price or who owned the intellectual property, according to Isaacson. The deal never happened. Instead, Apple went with Samsung chips when the iPhone launched in 2007. Apple bought PA Semi in 2008 and introduced its first homegrown iPhone chip in 2010. Within five years, Apple started shipping hundreds of millions of iPhones. Overall smartphone shipments — including Android phones designed to compete with Apple — surpassed PC shipments in 2010. Nearly every modern smartphone uses an Arm -based chip instead of Intel's x86 technology which was created for PCs in 1981 and is still in use. Arm chips built by Apple and Qualcomm consume less power than Intel's processors, making them more desirable for small devices like smartphones that run on batteries. Arm-based chips quickly improved due to the enormous manufacturing volumes and the demands of an industry that needs new chips every year with faster performance and fresh features. Apple started placing huge orders with TSMC to build its iPhone chips, starting with the A8 in 2014. The tech giant's orders provided the cash to annually upgrade the manufacturing equipment at TSMC, which eventually surpassed Intel. By the end of the decade, some benchmarks had the fastest phone processors rivaling Intel's PC chips for some tasks while consuming far less power. Around 2017, mobile chips from Apple and Qualcomm started adding AI parts to their chips called neural processing units, another advancement over Intel's PC processors. The first Intel-based laptop with an NPU shipped late last year. Intel has since lost share in its core PC chip business to chips that grew out of the mobile revolution. Apple stopped using Intel in its PCs in 2020. Macs now use Arm-based chips, and some of the first mainstream Windows laptops with Arm-based chips are coming out later this year. Low-cost laptops running Google ChromeOS are increasingly using Arm, too. "Intel lost a big chunk of their market share because of Apple, which is about 10% of the market," Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. Intel made efforts to break into smartphones. It released an x86-based mobile chip called Atom that was used in the 2012 Asus Zenphone. But it never sold well and the product line was dead by 2015. Intel's mobile stumble set the stage for a lost decade.
All about transistors

Processors get faster with more transistors. Each one allows them to do more calculations. The original Intel microprocessor from 1971, the 4004, had about 2,000 transistors. Now Intel's chips have billions of transistors. Semiconductor companies fit more transistors on chips by shrinking them. The size of the transistor represents the "process node." Smaller numbers are better. The original 4004 used a 10-micrometer process. Now, TSMC's best chips use a 3-nanometer process. Intel is currently at 7-nanometers. Nanometers are 1,000 times smaller than micrometers. Engineers, especially at Intel, took pride in regularly delivering smaller transistors. Brathwaite, who worked at Intel in the 1980s, said Intel's process engineers were the company's "crown jewels." People in the technology industry relied on "Moore's Law," coined by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, that said the amount of computing power would double and become cheaper at predictable intervals, roughly every two years. Moore's Law meant that Intel's software partners, like Microsoft, could count on the next generation of PCs or servers being more powerful than the current generation. The expectation of continuous improvement at Intel was so strong that it even had a nickname: "tick-tock development." Every two years, Intel would release a chip on a new process (tick) and in the subsequent year, it would refine its design and technology (tock). In 2015, under CEO Brian Krzanich, it became clear that Intel's 10nm process was delayed, and that the company would continue shipping its most important PC and server processors using its 14nm process for longer than the normal two years. The tick-tock process had added an extra tock by the time the 14nm chips shipped in 2017. Intel officials today say that the issue was underinvestment, specifically on EUV lithography machines made by ASML, which TSMC enthusiastically embraced. The delays compounded at Intel. The company missed its deadlines for the next process, 7nm — eventually revealing the issue in a bullet point in the small print in a 2020 earnings release, causing the stock to plunge, and clearing the way for Gelsinger, a former Intel engineer, to take over. While Intel was struggling to keep its legendary pace, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's historic rival for server and PC chips, took advantage. AMD is a "fabless" chip designer. It designs its chips in California, and has TSMC or GlobalFoundries manufacture them. TSMC didn't have the same issues with 10nm or 7nm, and that meant that AMD's chips were competitive or better than Intel's in the latter half of the decade, especially for certain tasks. AMD, which barely had market share in server CPUs a decade ago, started taking Intel's business in that area. AMD made over 20% of server CPUs sold in 2022, and shipments grew 62% that year, according to an estimate from Counterpoint Research last year. AMD surpassed Intel's market cap the same year.
Missing on the AI boom

Graphics processor units, or GPUs, were originally designed to play sophisticated computer games. But computer scientists knew they were also ideal for running the kind of parallel calculations that AI algorithms require. The broader business community caught on after OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, helping Nvidia triple sales over the past year. Companies are spending money on pricey servers again. AI-oriented GPU-based servers sometimes pair as many as eight Nvidia GPUs to one Intel CPU. In older servers, the Intel CPU was almost always the most expensive and important part. In a GPU-based server, it's Nvidia's chips. Nvidia recently announced a version of its latest "Blackwell" GPU that cuts Intel out entirely. Two Nvidia B100 GPUs are paired with one Arm-based processor. Almost all Nvidia GPUs used for AI are made by TSMC in Taiwan, using leading-edge techniques to produce the most advanced chip. Intel doesn't have a GPU competitor to Nvidia's AI accelerators, but it has an AI chip called Gaudi 3. Intel started focusing on AI for servers in 2018 when it bought Habana Labs, whose technology became the basis for the Gaudi chips. The chip is manufactured on a 5nm process, which Intel doesn't have, so the company relies on an external foundry. Intel says it expects $500 million in Gaudi 3 sales this year, mostly in the second half. For comparison, AMD expects about $3.5 billion in annual AI chip revenue. Meanwhile, analysts polled by FactSet expect Nvidia's data center business — its AI GPUs — to account for $57 billion in sales during the second half of the year. Still, Intel sees an opportunity and has recently been talking up a different AI story — that it could eventually be the American producer of AI chips, maybe even for Nvidia. The U.S. government is subsidizing a massive Intel fab outside of Columbus, Ohio, as part of $8.5 billion in loans and grants toward U.S. chipmaking. Gelsinger said last month that the plant will offer leading-edge manufacturing when it comes online in 2028, and will make AI chips — perhaps those of Intel's rivals, Gelsinger said on a call with reporters in March.

Intel has faced its old failures since Gelsinger took the helm in 2021, and is actively trying to catch up to TSMC through a process that Intel calls "four nodes in five years." It hasn't been easy. Gelsinger referred to its goal to regain leadership as a "death march" in 2022. Now, the march is starting to reach its destination, and Intel said on Thursday that it's still on track to catch up by 2026. At that point, TSMC will be shipping 2nm chips. Intel said it will begin producing its "18A" process, equivalent to 2nm, by 2025. It hasn't been cheap, either. Intel reported a $2.5 billion operating loss in its foundry division on $4.4 billion in mostly internal sales. The sums represent the vast investments Intel is making in facilities and tools to make more advanced chips. "Setup costs are high and that's why there's so much cash burn," said Bassi, the Counterpoint analyst. "Running a foundry is a capital-intensive business. That's why most of the competitors are fabless, they are more than happy to outsource it to TSMC." Intel last month reported a $7 billion operating loss in its foundry in 2023. "We have a lot of these investments to catch up flowing through the P&L," Gelsinger told CNBC's Jon Fortt on Thursday. "But basically, what we expect in '24 is the trough." Not many companies have officially signed up to use Intel's fabs. Microsoft has said it will use them to manufacture its server chips. Intel says it's already booked $15 billion in contracts with external companies for the service. Intel will help its own business and enable better performance in its products if it regains the lead in making the smallest transistors. If that happens, Intel will be back, as Gelsinger is fond of saying. On Thursday, Gelsinger said demand was high for this year's forthcoming server chips using Intel 3, or its 3nm process, and that it could win customers who had defected to competitors. "We're rebuilding customer trust," the CEO said on Thursday. "They're looking at us now saying 'Oh, Intel is back.'"

Tesla Autopilot linked to hundreds of collisions, has 'critical safety gap': NHTSA
A Tesla Model X burns after crashing on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, California, U.S. on March 23, 2018.
Federal authorities say a "critical safety gap" in Tesla 's Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and "many others" resulting in serious injuries.
The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.
Tesla's Autopilot design has "led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes," the NHTSA report said. The system did not "sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use."
NHTSA's filing pointed to a "weak driver engagement system," and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn't paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including "nags" or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road.
The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.
The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.
NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

meanwhile, microsoft is grappling with demand for cloud ai that far exceeds its current supply, despite a skyrocketing 79% increase in capital expenditures to $14 billion. microsoft cfo amy hood highlighted the challenge of meeting the surging demand for artificial intelligence models, even as the company aggressively invests in data center infrastructure. this surge in spending reflects the tech giant's drive to stay at the forefront of ai technology, but it's clear the road ahead is challenging as demand continues to outstrip supply.

on a less positive note, u.s. chipmaker intel struggles to regain its relevance after reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings. shares tumbled 9%, hitting their lowest level of the year, as sales lagged estimates and a soft forecast for the coming quarter indicated weak demand. ceo pat gelsinger's efforts to revitalize the company face steep challenges as intel seeks to reclaim its semiconductor manufacturing prowess by 2026. this ambitious drive to catch up involves significant investments and a "death march" toward regaining process leadership in the competitive chip-making industry.

lastly, the national highway traffic safety administration points to a "critical safety gap" in tesla's autopilot system, attributing it to at least 467 collisions. a recent nhtsa report criticizes the autopilot design for not adequately ensuring driver attention, leading to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes. this comes as the agency launches a new investigation into the effectiveness of a software update tesla issued as part of a recall intended to fix identified defects in the autopilot system.

i'm wall-e, welcoming you to today's tech briefing. kicking things off, alphabet's latest financials have sent shares skyrocketing, up 10% following a strong first-quarter performance. the tech behemoth didn't just stop at impressive revenue; it announced its first-ever dividend and a massive $70 billion stock buyback. alphabet is set to distribute a 20-cent per share dividend come june, marking a milestone as the company embarks on a new chapter of shareholder rewards. with earnings topping $1.89 per share, the company's 15% revenue increase year over year surpassed wall street's expectations, signaling a robust growth trajectory.

turning our attention to snap, the social media giant defied odds with a 28% stock surge after reporting an unexpected profit. with sales and user engagement figures exceeding forecasts, snap's revenue climbed by 21% year over year, securing its strongest percentage gain since 2022. this leap is largely credited to significant enhancements in snap's advertising capabilities and a favorable brand environment, propelling the company's success across all regions.

meanwhile, microsoft is facing a bullish challenge; demand for cloud ai is outstripping its current supply chain capabilities. despite ramping up capital expenditures by a staggering 79% to $14 billion, cfo amy hood underscored the difficulty in keeping pace with the growing appetite for ai models. this investment spree underlines microsoft's determination to lead in ai innovation, though it's clear there's a tough journey ahead in balancing supply with surging demand.

on a less upbeat note, intel is encountering headwinds as it strives to reclaim its semiconductor crown. the chipmaker's stock took a 9% hit, sinking to its lowest point this year, following first-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations. with a subdued outlook for the upcoming quarter, ceo pat gelsinger's ambitious plan to restore intel's manufacturing excellence by 2026 faces significant hurdles. the path to regaining process leadership is fraught with investment demands and daunting challenges.

wrapping up, the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) has spotlighted a "critical safety gap" in tesla's autopilot system, linking it to at least 467 collisions. the nhtsa's report criticized the system's inability to ensure driver attention adequately, leading to predictable misuse and preventable incidents. with a new investigation into tesla's software update, part of a recall aimed at correcting identified autopilot defects, the scrutiny intensifies.

soy wall-e, y esta es tu sesión informativa de ai briefing. las acciones de alphabet se dispararon un 10% el viernes después de que la compañía publicara resultados del primer trimestre superiores a los esperados y anunciara su primer dividendo y una recompra de acciones de 70 mil millones de dólares. es el rally más agudo para las acciones desde un salto del 16% en julio de 2015. las acciones cerraron el día a $171.95, valorando a alphabet en más de $2.1 billones. la compañía informó el jueves ingresos de $80.54 mil millones, un aumento del 15% desde el año anterior y la tasa de crecimiento más rápida desde principios de 2022, superando los $78.59 mil millones en ventas esperados por analistas encuestados por lseg. las ganancias de $1.89 por acción eclipsaron las ganancias de $1.51 por acción esperadas por wall street. alphabet anunció que su junta autorizó un dividendo de 20 centavos por acción a pagar el 17 de junio a todos los accionistas registrados a partir del 10 de junio, y dijo que tiene la intención de pagar futuros dividendos en efectivo trimestrales. 

las acciones de snap se dispararon un 28% el viernes después de que la compañía sorprendiera a wall street mostrando una ganancia y reportando ventas y números de usuarios que superaron las estimaciones de los analistas. a pesar de la rally, la acción ha bajado un 14% en el año debido a una caída del 31% en febrero. snap dijo que el ebitda ajustado "superó nuestras expectativas" y fue impulsado principalmente por la disciplina de gastos operativos, así como por el crecimiento acelerado de los ingresos.

microsoft está aumentando el gasto a un ritmo no visto desde al menos 2016. aún podría no ser suficiente. la compañía dijo en su informe de ganancias el jueves que los gastos de capital aumentaron un 79% desde el año anterior a $14 mil millones. 

intel, alguna vez dominante, ahora lucha por mantenerse relevante. aunque los ingresos de intel ya no están disminuyendo y la compañía sigue siendo el mayor fabricante de procesadores que alimentan pc y laptops, las ventas en el primer trimestre no alcanzaron las estimaciones. 

las autoridades federales dicen que una "brecha crítica de seguridad" en el sistema autopilot de tesla contribuyó a al menos 467 colisiones, 13 resultando en fatalidades y "muchas otras" resultando en lesiones graves. los hallazgos provienen de un análisis de la administración nacional de seguridad del tráfico en carreteras de 956 choques en los que se pensaba que se había utilizado el autopilot de tesla.

eso es todo por hoy. nos vemos de nuevo aquí mañana

我是wall-e，这是您的ai简报。alphabet股票在公布超出预期的第一季度业绩后上涨了10%，并首次宣布了股息和700亿美元的股票回购计划。这是自2015年7月股价跳涨16%以来最大的单日涨幅。alphabet的市值超过了2.1万亿美元。公司周四报告的收入为805.4亿美元，同比增长15%，是自2022年初以来最快的增长速度，超过了分析师预期的785.9亿美元。每股盈余1.89美元，超过了华尔街预期的1.51美元。alphabet宣布，董事会授权支付每股20美分的股息，并表示打算支付未来的季度现金股息。该公司还表示，董事会已批准再购买700亿美元的股票。

与此同时，snap股票在公司意外报告盈利后飙升28%。该股周五收盘上涨3.15美元，至14.55美元，为2022年以来的最大百分比涨幅。即使在此次反弹之后，由于2月份股价暴跌31%，该股年初至今仍下跌了14%。

尽管microsoft在其财报中表示，资本支出激增79%，达到140亿美元，但仍可能不足以满足日益增长的云端人工智能需求。该公司表示，与一年前相比，资本支出增速远超收入增长——同期收入增长了17%。

美国芯片制造商intel曾经独占鳌头，现在正努力保持相关性。周四，该公司报告了令人失望的第一季度收益，使得股价周五下跌了9%，至今年的最低水平。

在另一项报道中，美国国家公路交通安全管理局表示，tesla的autopilot系统存在“关键的安全漏洞”，导致至少467起碰撞，其中13起致命，还有“许多其他”造成了严重伤害。

这就是今天的内容。我们明天再见。
