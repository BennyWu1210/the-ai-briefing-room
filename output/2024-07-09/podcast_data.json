But Hebbia has not yet filed an updated disclosure on this funding round to the SEC, and the latest one at this time still says it was raising around $100 million of new equity.\nHebbia, which was founded by George Sivulka while he was working on his PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford, had ARR of $13 million and the company was profitable when it was pitching investors on the deal, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Sivulka, who is the startup\u2019s sole founder and CEO, declined to comment on Hebbia\u2019s revenue or profitability. But he said that the startup\u2019s revenue grew by 15x over the last 18 months.\nThe $700 million valuation implies that investors valued Hebbia at about 54 times ARR. Such heady valuations were common at the height of the pandemic-infused boom and are now routinely assigned to buzzy AI startups. Hebbia\u2019s closest analogues, Glean and Harvey, had valuations of slightly over 60x ARR, according to the Information\u2019s reporting.\nFounded in 2020, Hebbia initially worked on an AI-powered search and summarization tool. The company later revamped itself as an AI analyst. Matrix, Hebbia\u2019s main product, can ingest multiple files of unlimited length, and respond to users\u2019 inquiries in a tabular format, similar to a spreadsheet. For example, the Matrix can sift through SEC filings and other documents to organize and compare information about a specific company and its competitors, Sivulka said.\nHebbia currently sells its software primarily to asset managers, investment banks and other financial institutions. But the startup is expanding its offering to other areas, including law firms and pharmaceutical companies, Sivulka said.\nThe company\u2019s product is already being used by 30% of all asset managers, who use Hebbia for due diligence, asset pricing and other research, according to Sivulka. The fresh funding is being used to grow its team, continue to sell to the financial services industry and expand to other verticals.\nHebbia\u2019s list of customers includes investment bank Centerview Partners, Charlesbank and legal firm Fenwick.\nSivulka has been described as a wunderkind. He worked at NASA as a teenager and graduated from Stanford with a bachelor\u2019s degree in math in 2.5 years.\nHe also stands out from other enterprise-focused founders for not having direct business experience nor a business-focused co-founder.\n\ntitle1:\nFTC bans NGL from offering its anonymous social app to minors\ndescription1:\nIn a first, the Federal Trade Commission is banning an app from serving users under the age of 18. The agency announced on Tuesday that it\u2019s banning NGL, an anonymous social app, from marketing or offering its app to minors. NGL will pay $5 million to settle the lawsuit.\nLaunched in 2021, NGL rose to the top of the app store based on its premise of allowing users to post links to their social accounts that friends can click on to send in anonymous questions.\nThe FTC and the Los Angeles DA\u2019s office allege that the app and its co-founders not only marketed NGL to minors, but that they also falsely claimed that its AI content moderation system filtered out harmful messages and cyberbullying.\nThe complaint also alleges that NGL sent fake questions that appeared to come from real people to trick users into paying its $9.99 monthly subscription to get hints about who sent the messages.\nTechCrunch found this to be the case back in 2022, when we shared an NGL link inviting questions in an Instagram Story that was live for just a mere moment before we removed it. A few hours after posting the link, we received questions from half a dozen \u201cpeople\u201d on NGL. But in reality, no one had seen our link because it wasn\u2019t live for more than a second.\nThe FTC says that NGL resorted to automatically sending users fake computer-generated questions in 2022 after failing to generate interest in its app. Users started receiving fake messages such as \u201care you straight?\u201d or \u201cI know what you did,\u201d according to the complaint. When users saw the questions, NGL would encourage them to buy the app\u2019s monthly subscription to get hints about the identity, despite it coming from a bot.\n\u201cNGL\u2019s bait-and-switch tactic prompted many consumers to complain, which NGL executives laughed off, dismissing such users as \u2018suckers\u2019,\u201d the FTC says.\nIn addition, the complaint alleges that NGL failed to clearly disclose consent for recurring charges for its paid service and that the company violated the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule, which requires apps that are directed to children under 13 to inform their parents about the personal information they collect.\n\u201cNGL marketed its app to kids and teens despite knowing that it was exposing them to cyberbullying and harassment,\u201d said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a press release. \u201cIn light of NGL\u2019s reckless disregard for kids\u2019 safety, the FTC\u2019s order would ban NGL from marketing or offering its app to those under 18. We will keep cracking down on businesses that unlawfully exploit kids for profit.\u201d\nAs part of the settlement, NGL has to implement an age gate that prevents new and current users from accessing the app if they are under 18. NGL is also prohibited from misrepresenting the sender of messages and required to disclose information about recurring charges. Plus, the company is prohibited from misrepresenting the capabilities of its AI content moderation system\u2019s ability to filter out cyberbullying.\n\u201cAfter nearly two years of cooperating with the FTC\u2019s investigation, we view this resolution as an opportunity to make NGL better than ever for our users and we think the agreement is in our best interest,\u201d said NGL co-founder Joao Figueiredo in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWhile we believe many of the allegations around the youth of our user base are factually incorrect, we anticipate that the agreed upon age-gating and other procedures will now provide direction for others in our space, and hopefully improve policies generally,\u201d he added.\nThe settlement represents one of the most significant actions taken by the FTC under Chair Lina Khan with the aim of preventing social media services from profiting from practices that have the potential to harm children.\n\ntitle2:\nThe developers suing over GitHub Copilot got dealt a major blow in court\ndescription2:\nA judge has tossed nearly all of the claims a group of developers brought against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI in a copyright lawsuit filed in 2022, as reported earlier by The Register. In a court order unsealed last week, a California judge left only two claims standing: one that accuses the companies of an open-source license violation and another that alleges breach of contract.\nThe original lawsuit made 22 claims against the trio, accusing them of violating copyright laws by allowing the AI-powered GitHub Copilot coding assistant to train on developers\u2019 work. Microsoft, the owner of GitHub, uses OpenAI\u2019s technology to power the tool. All three companies asked the court to throw out the lawsuit in January, but Judge Jon Tigar denied their request.\nHowever, Judge Tigar\u2019s latest ruling deals a blow to the accusation that GitHub Copilot violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by suggesting code without proper attribution. Although the court previously ruled that Copilot\u2019s suggested code wasn\u2019t close enough to its original source, an amended version of the complaint takes issue with GitHub\u2019s duplication detection filter, which users can toggle on to \u201cdetect and suppress\u201d Copilot suggestions matching public code found on GitHub.\nThe amended lawsuit argues that GitHub gives users the option to \u201creceive identical code\u201d when the filter is turned off. It also cites a study that shows how AI models can \u201cmemorize\u201d and regurgitate parts of their training data, which could potentially include copyrighted code.\nThis didn\u2019t hold up in court, as Judge Tigar determined that the code GitHub allegedly copied from developers wasn\u2019t similar enough to their original work. He also mentions a part of the cited study that says GitHub Copilot \u201crarely emits memorized code in benign situations.\u201d Judge Tigar dismissed this allegation with prejudice, meaning the developers can\u2019t refile the claim. The court also dismissed requests for punitive damages, as well as monetary relief in the form of unjust enrichment.\n\ntitle3:\nCompany to cut 10% of workforce\ndescription3:\nDaniel Dines, Co-founder & CEO at UiPath addresses the audience during the third day of the Web Summit 2021 at Parque das Nacoes in Lisbon.\nUiPath , a developer of automation software, is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 420 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring, the company said in filing with the SEC on Tuesday.\nMost of the layoffs will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company said. That quarter ends next April.\nUiPath shares dropped about 7% on Tuesday to close at $11.93 and have now lost more than half their value this year. The Nasdaq is up 23% over that stretch. UiPath has faced a dramatic slowing of revenue growth following its IPO in 2021, which was one of the largest U.S. software offerings on record.\nWhile UiPath reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, the company lowered its revenue guidance for the full year, and said it now expects between $1.4 billion and $1.41 billion compared with previous guidance of $1.55 billion to $1.56 billion. Its current forecast would equal annual growth of about 7.5%, down from 24% the prior year.\nUiPath makes software that automates repetitive tasks. The company announced in May that CEO Rob Enslin was resigning effective June 1, and would be succeeded by co-founder Daniel Dines, who had stepped down as co-CEO in January. That move drove the stock down 30%.\nUiPath said Tuesday that it expects to incur $15 million to $20 million in costs related to the layoffs, and total restructuring costs between $17 million and $25 million. The company previously announced two rounds of job cuts in 2022.\n\"These changes reflect efforts to reshape the organization by streamlining the Company's structure, particularly in operational and corporate functions, better prioritizing our go-to-market investments and focusing our research and development investments on artificial intelligence and driving innovation across our platform,\" UiPath said in Tuesday's statement.\n\u2014 CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed to this report.\n\ntitle4:\nStolen crypto doubled to $1.38 billion in first half of 2024: TRM Labs\ndescription4:\nHackers more than doubled their cryptocurrency spoils in the first half of 2024 compared with a year ago, a report from blockchain research firm TRM Labs showed.\nThe report said hackers looted crypto valued at $1.38 billion between Jan. 1 and June 24, more than double the $657 million during the same period a year ago. Like last year, a handful of large attacks drove the increase in plundered crypto, with the top five hacks accounting for 70% of the amount stolen in the first half of the year.\nTop attack vectors in 2024 include private key and seed phrase compromises, said TRM Labs. A seed phrase is a sequence of random words that stores the information needed to access or recover a crypto wallet.\nThe largest heist so far this year netted more than $300 million worth of bitcoin from Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin.\nHackers used stolen private keys or address poisoning, where attackers send a small amount of crypto from a wallet with a similar-looking address crafted to mimic yours or your recipient's, with the intention to trick the victim into sending funds to the wrong wallet.\nCrypto addresses are long, complex strings of characters that are difficult to memorize or manually enter without making mistakes.\nTRM Labs said there have not been fundamental changes in the crypto ecosystem's security that could have contributed to the increase. It said the number of attacks and attack vectors were not significantly different year over year.\nBut the firm noted that crypto prices have been higher on average in the first half of this year, which could have contributed to the higher value.\"\n\nResponse:",
