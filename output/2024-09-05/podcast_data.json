Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Salesforce intends to close the deal in the quarter ending in January 2025 if regulators give it their blessing, according to a statement.\nThe startup, formerly known as OwnBackup, was valued at $3.35 billion in a 2021 funding round. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud software company's venture arm, invested in that round and earlier ones.\nThe proposed deal would mark the return of sizable deals for Salesforce, less than two years after co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said the board was eliminating a committee on mergers and acquisitions.\nBenioff's pronouncement came after activist investors bought stakes in Salesforce and raised questions about profitability after the company had splurged on expensive assets, including MuleSoft and Slack, without delivering major growth in return.\nThe decline in value for Own reflects a more sluggish backdrop for software companies.\nIn late 2021, investors became less interested in cloud software, which had seen a surge in adoption in 2020 thanks to remote-work policies instituted after Covid. Central banks raised rates to ward off inflation, prompting money-losing cloud companies to focus more on profitability. Enterprises aiming to slim down information-technology budgets consolidated their purchases, burdening single-product companies, including startups and publicly traded companies.\nAnaplan, Avalara, Coupa, Everbridge, Qualtrics, Sumo Logic and Zendesk all went private.\nOwn, which had specialized in helping Salesforce clients, sought to diversify. In its 2021 funding announcement, it touted its intent to work with Microsoft's Dynamics enterprise software that competes with Salesforce's core applications. Support for ServiceNow followed.\nSalesforce in recent weeks has also revealed plans to buy smaller startups PredictSpring and Tenyx.\nSalesforce said the Own acquisition wouldn't impact Salesforce's shareholder return initiatives, and said the deal would be accretive to free cash flow starting in the second year after the deal closes.\nIn April, data-management software maker Informatica said it was not in talks to be acquired after media outlets reported Salesforce was interested in buying the company for around $10 billion.\n\"We're going to be looking at products organically, but, yes, we will continue to look at products inorganically,\" Benioff told analysts on Salesforce's May earnings call. \"But as we've committed to you, if we're looking at a large-scale acquisition, we're going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers, that it's accretive, that it has the right metrics.\"\nWATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff goes one-on-one with Jim Cramer\n\ntitle2:\nBroadcom (AVGO) earnings report Q3 2024\ndescription2:\nBroadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.\nBroadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.\nHere is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:\nEarnings per share : $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected\n: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected Revenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected\nBroadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.\nBroadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.\nThe company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.\nBroadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Google's TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.\n\"Broadcom's third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware,\" Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcom's infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company's VMware acquisition.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft gives deepfake porn victims a tool to scrub images from Bing search\ndescription4:\nThe advancement of generative AI tools has created a new problem for the internet: the proliferation of synthetic nude images resembling real people. On Thursday, Microsoft took a major step to give revenge porn victims a tool to stop its Bing search engine from returning these images.\nMicrosoft announced a partnership with StopNCII, an organization that allows victims of revenge porn to create a digital fingerprint of these explicit images, real or not, on their device. StopNCII\u2019s partners then use that digital fingerprint, or \u201chash\u201d as it\u2019s technically known, to scrub the image from their platforms. Microsoft\u2019s Bing joins Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, Pornhub and OnlyFans in partnering with StopNCII, and using its digital fingerprints to stop the spread of revenge porn.\nIn a blog post, Microsoft says it already took action on 268,000 explicit images being returned through Bing\u2019s image search in a pilot through the end of August with StopNCII\u2019s database. Previously, Microsoft offered a direct reporting tool, but the company says that\u2019s proven to be not enough.\n\u201cWe have heard concerns from victims, experts, and other stakeholders that user reporting alone may not scale effectively for impact or adequately address the risk that imagery can be accessed via search,\u201d said Microsoft in its blog post on Thursday.\nYou can imagine how much worse that problem would be on a significantly more popular search engine: Google.\nGoogle Search offers its own tools to report and remove explicit images from its search results, but has faced criticism from former employees and victims for not partnering with StopNCII, according to a Wired investigation. Since 2020, Google users in South Korea have reported 170,000 search and YouTube links for unwanted sexual content, Wired reported.\nThe AI deepfake nude problem is already widespread. StopNCII\u2019s tools only work for people over 18, but \u201cundressing\u201d sites are already creating problems for high schoolers around the country. Unfortunately, the United States doesn\u2019t have an AI deepfake porn law to hold anyone accountable, so the country is relying on a patchwork approach of state and local laws to address the issue.\nSan Francisco prosecutors announced a lawsuit in August to take down 16 of the most \u201cundressing\u201d sites. According to a tracker for deepfake porn laws created by Wired, 23 American states have passed laws to address nonconsensual deepfakes, while nine have struck down proposals.\n\ntitle6:\nUS and UK sign legally enforceable AI treaty\ndescription6:\nThe US, UK, and European Union have signed the first \u201clegally binding\u201d treaty on AI, which is supposed to ensure its use aligns with \u201chuman rights, democracy and the rule of law,\u201d according to the Council of Europe.\nThe treaty, called the Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, lays out key principles AI systems must follow, such as protecting user data, respecting the law, and keeping practices transparent. Each country that signs the treaty must \u201cadopt or maintain appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures\u201d that reflect the framework.\nAndorra, Georgia, Iceland, Norway, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, and Israel also signed the framework, which has been in the works since 2019.\nOver the past several months, we\u2019ve seen a swath of other AI safety agreements emerge \u2014 but the majority don\u2019t have consequences for the signatories who break their commitments. Even though this new treaty is supposed to be \u201clegally binding,\u201d the Financial Times points out that \u201ccompliance is measured primarily through monitoring, which is a relatively weak form of enforcement.\u201d\n\ntitle8:\nUS charges five Russian military hackers with targeting Ukraine's government with destructive malware\ndescription8:\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice accused five members of Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency of hacking several Ukrainian government agencies, an unnamed U.S. government agency in Maryland and computers belonging to 26 NATO countries, among other victims.\nThe DOJ announced the indictment of the five members of Russia\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate, also known as GRU, and in particular its hacking Unit 29155. The indictment names Russian GRU colonel and commanding officer of cyber operations, Yuriy Denisov; lieutenants Vladislav Borovkov, Denis Denisenko, Dmitriy Goloshubov and Nikolay Korchagin; and a civilian co-conspirator, Amin Stigal, who was previously indicted for some of the same crimes.\nProsecutors allege that the six indicted individuals were behind the WhisperGate cyberattack, an operation that was designed to appear like a ransomware attack on the Ukrainian government, but was actually a destructive attack that would make the targeted computers unusable. The Russian government has been accused of launching WhisperGate in support of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.\nAccording to the indictment, Denisov, Denisenko, Korchagin, Goloshubov and Borovkov, and other unnamed individuals, planned meetings at Cafe Shokoladnitsa in the Sofia Shopping Center in Moscow. The indictment does not explain how the U.S. government was able to get information about these meetings, nor the pictures of the suspects, but it suggests the authorities gained significant access to the hackers\u2019 infrastructure.\n\u201cThe message is clear. To the GRU and to the Russians: We are onto you, we penetrated your systems. The FBI, the Department of Justice will be relentless in pursuing you, so you better pay attention to the fact that we have gotten to you, and we are in your systems,\u201d Matt Olsen, the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said during a press conference announcing the indictments.\nThe indictment included details about the six Russians\u2019 cyber operations, as well as a group picture of four of the lieutenants, and one of general Denisov.\nGRU lieutenants Denisenki, Korchagin, Goloshubov and Borovkov. Image Credits: U.S. Department of Justice\nThe six Russians are accused of hacking several government and civilian targets in Ukraine over the last couple of years, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Treasury, Judiciary Administration, several other government departments and the state-owned Ukrainian railways.\nAround October 2022, the six allegedly hacked what the indictment only described as the transportation infrastructure of \u201ca Central European Country.\u201d As previously reported, the timing of this attack suggests it was the cyberattack against Denmark, which caused delays and outages across the country\u2019s train network, according to the indictment.\nContact Us Do you have more information about these attacks against Ukraine and other targets?
